		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've always taken my <em>just for fun</em> rides south of where I live, but last weekend got to wondering what sort of roads run north of the Golden Gate. A quick Google Map survey answered the question: good ones.

I'd take the familiar Highway 1 across the Golden Gate, out toward Stinson Beach (I've heard about it, never been) and then enjoy the Panoramic Highway back to 1 for the return leg. I use Highway 1 to get to the fun roads south of me and usually treat it as the warm-up and cool-down section of my ride. South of me, Highway 1 is very tame, taking a scenic, relatively quick (45-60 mph) route straight down the coast.

<div class="google-map"><iframe frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;saddr=US-101+N&amp;daddr=37.878647,-122.533779+to:Panoramic+Hwy+to:Panoramic+Hwy+to:Panoramic+Hwy&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=FVA_QQIdhBuz-A%3B%3BFVJNQgIdHL6w-A%3BFaBzQgIdA2mx-A%3BFdoUQgIdkfax-A&amp;mra=dpe&amp;mrcr=0&amp;mrsp=1&amp;sz=13&amp;via=1,3&amp;sll=37.869433,-122.555065&amp;sspn=0.097839,0.214748&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=37.874311,-122.553005&amp;spn=0.097833,0.214748&amp;output=embed&amp;s=AARTsJq5VktdwKykP7HGOKAPC5EagHw6PA"></iframe></div>

But the Highway 1 north of the Golden Gate isn't the same docile road. Despite not looking as curvaceous on a map as other roads I've traveled, the stretch of 1 between the 101 and Stinson Beach is some very demanding tarmac. Lots of blind corners, narrow lanes, and even some spilled gravel encroaching on the roadway from the imminently close hillsides. A very fun ride for sure, but not a fast one.

<div class="pull-quote">The view grows increasingly picturesque as the road winds down toward the ocean</div>

With speed out of the question, the best part of the ride toward Stinson is the view, which grows increasingly picturesque as the road winds down toward the ocean. The mountainside attack I'd planned before I left San Francisco was defeated before it could launch--the treacherous roads and inspiring vistas were enough to put aggressive riding on hold.

Just before pulling up to Stinson Beach proper, I veered west onto the Panoramic Highway. The road winds just a little bit more sharply, the curves decreasing in radius with more elevation change, and the rough texture of the road gives it enough of an edge that I, instead of speeding up, let an aggressive Saab driver pass me from behind.

Taking a brief pit stop on the roadside to give respite to my head, throbbing from a newly-discovered pressure point in my Scorpion helmet, I witnessed the first and only few sport bikes I saw on the ride. I'm not sure if it's the time of year, but I expected to see more bikers on roads like those. Had I ventured south toward Alice's, I doubt I'd've been so alone.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Took Friday off</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>I'm writing this more than two months after the fact, but I remember the day vividly.</em>

With my accrued vacation time about to max out, I took a Friday off for no reason other than to spend paid time off to make room for more paid time off. With the girlfriend at work and the urge to brush aside professional obligations, I fueled up the Ninja and headed south for Santa Cruz. This would be no mere afternoon ride--I had the entire day to myself.

<div class="google-map"><iframe frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;saddr=CA-1&amp;daddr=CA-1+to:CA-84%2FLa+Honda+Rd+to:CA-9%2FCentral+Ave+to:CA-1%2FCoast+Rd+to:37.306829,-122.405548&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=FQYEPgIdVwaz-A%3BFdmTOQIdmFy0-A%3BFWl4OgIdSGS2-A%3BFWpSNwIduEu4-A%3BFeQ_NAIdqFu4-A%3B&amp;mra=dme&amp;mrcr=1&amp;mrsp=5&amp;sz=12&amp;via=1,3,4&amp;sll=37.259299,-122.33963&amp;sspn=0.286368,0.549316&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=37.235795,-122.275085&amp;spn=0.394698,0.858994&amp;output=embed&amp;s=AARTsJrIIHb8-vd7JH9bVPj9xwuTCo2IFw"></iframe></div>

I rode Highway 1 out of the city and kept on it until after Half Moon Bay where I found 84, a highway I frequently read about on the <a href="http://www.bayarearidersforum.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=20">local moto forum</a> but had never ridden before.<!--more-->

<em>What a road</em>.

<div class="pull-quote">The perfect blend for attack mode in relative safety</div>

84 comprises great turns, wide lanes, and pristine asphalt, the perfect blend for <em>attack mode</em> in relative safety. It's not the most technical (read: dangerous) road I've ridden, but it's probably the most fun. And adding to the perfection of the setting, it was midday Friday, all the weekend traffic nowhere to be seen. Though I did exchange thumbs up with an enthusiast conspicuously enjoying his Cobra-replica in the twisties.

Before long, I found myself at the junction of 84 and 35 and Alice's Restaurant. Stopped for a bit for some photos, but couldn't be torn away from the bike long enough to eat.

</div><!--/raw-->

From Alice's, I turned south down 35 where I was tightly tailed by a pair of pickup trucks no doubt driven by locals. I kept them off my back for a while, but preferred setting my own pace so I let the pair pass.

The turnoff for Highway 9 came abruptly. Heading deeper into the redwoods, the roads tunneled like secret cave passages through the thick trees. I pulled over to the side of the road on a particularly large turnout for another photo session before hopping back on the road to Santa Cruz.

Or that was the intention. Just a few turns further south, I found an infinitely better photo spot and cursed myself for stopping too early. It was a <em>hot</em> August day. I was in full gear. While riding, the rushing air was enough to keep me comfortable, but stopping, setting up the camera, and crouching to odd angles made the protective ensemble unbearable. I stopped for a few photos, enjoyed the view, and took off.

<a href="http://thesundaybe.st/media/santa_cruz_loop_04_big.jpg"><img src="http://thesundaybe.st/media/santa_cruz_loop_04_big.jpg"></a>

<a href="http://thesundaybe.st/media/santa_cruz_loop_01_big.jpg"><img src="http://thesundaybe.st/media/santa_cruz_loop_01_big.jpg"></a>

</div><!--/raw-->

Highway 9 eventually winds through some towns and is actually pretty slow going after the initial avalanche of phenomenal corners. Fine by me; after now about two hours of intense riding, a chill ride with some traffic was welcome.

I reached Santa Cruz at around 3:30 PM, having left home before noon. Were I in a hurry to reach Santa Cruz, I could be there in just over an hour via the freeways. But that would miss the point. I spent about an hour downtown, wandering the shops until the heat became unbearable. Stripped the insulating liner from my jacket, opened the zipper vents, and hopped onto Highway 1 for an easy, comfortable ride home. Or mostly comfortable--it actually got really cold further north! A reminder that micro-climates and changing weather are inseparable from Bay Area riding, no matter the time of year.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>It&#039;s wet</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've lived in San Francisco for going on five years but the irregular seasons here still baffle me. Through August and early September, I was dreading the end of summer and the start of rains, sure I'd have to soon hang up my leather jacket until spring. The baffling bit is that last weekend, the first weekend in November, was the first time the fall season showed its face. The rains retreated earlier this week but left behind a lingering dampness, an endless mist, enough to make things wet, not enough to soak a rider.

And not enough to keep me off the bike. I was actually hoping to make a more adventurous ride this weekend, maybe down to Alice's to sample their on-tap root beer, but the idea of spirited riding over damp, leaf-blanketed roads isn't terribly attractive at this time in my barely blossoming riding career. So I resigned to putting around town.

<div class="pull-quote">Looking for an excuse to ride</div>

Didn't go anywhere interesting, just to a couple of electronics stores, but I was more looking for an excuse to ride. An employee at one of the stores asked me about riding in the rain, then asked about my bike and said that his mom wants to get a new 250 but told her that if she got one he'd be riding it. For such a niche product--an entry-level sportbike--I'm often surprised by how many people are familiar with what the bike is. And then there are others like the guy that two weeks ago asked me at a stop light, "What size is it?" and seemed to drop his jaw when I gestured "two-five-oh."

<!--raw--><div class="photo-frame">

<a href="http://thesundaybe.st/media/itswet_01_big.jpg"><img src="http://thesundaybe.st/media/itswet_01_big.jpg"></a>

</div><!--/raw-->

I actually enjoy riding in the wet--the air is cool, the ambiance subdued, and I'm not interested in pushing the pace so it's generally pretty relaxed. At least the pace is. Despite the slow going, riding in the wet takes a lot of concentration from me. Watch out for metal gratings, avoid painted lines at stoplights, and <i>boy that's a lot of oil in that parking spot</i>. And obstacles aren't the only concern: I've got to keep extra following distance for slower, smoother braking, calculate my corner approaches to reduce the necessary lean. I half feel that the bike is a lot less delicate in the wet than I treat it, but I'd rather be safe than sorry.

By most any measure, it was a boring ride. Still loved it.]]></content:encoded>
		<excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[I've lived in San Francisco for going on five years but the irregular seasons here still baffle me. Through August and early September, I was dreading the end of summer and the start of rains, sure I'd have to soon hang up my leather jacket until spring. The baffling bit is that last weekend, the first weekend in November, was the first time the fall season showed its face. The rains retreated earlier this week but left behind a lingering dampness, an endless mist, enough to make things wet, not enough to soak a rider.]]></excerpt:encoded>

				<title>HJC CL-SP v Scorpion EXO-400</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The date is sometime late February, 2008. I'm anxious for my upcoming appointment with <a href="http://www.msf-usa.org/">MSF</a>, and sleeping poorly because I can't stop dreaming about riding. The only indulgence I can afford myself is piecing together a set of full gear, and the first order of business is picking a helmet.

Committing oneself to riding can quickly grow costly--there's the cost of the bike, the cost of MSF, a helmet, and if you're healthily concerned about safety the cost of riding boots, pants, an armored jacket and gauntlet gloves. It's easy to get carried away with spending, but I'm not that ballin'. When it came to choosing a helmet, a $400 Shoei was out of the question.

There aren't many quality resources for helmet reviews online, though <a href="http://www.webbikeworld.com/Reviewed-motorcycle-products/Products.htm"><i>webBikeWorld</i></a>'s got a nice collection of helmet evals covering lids of all prices. The helmets aren't compared to each other, more reviewed on their own merits--those reviews and some online shopping lead me to the HJC CL-SP. Matte gray, size small.<!--more-->

<!--raw--><div class="photo-frame">

<a href="http://thesundaybe.st/media/helmet_02.jpg"><img src="http://thesundaybe.st/media/helmet_02.jpg" title="HJC CL-SP with optional breath guard"></a>

</div><!--/raw-->

A couple of coworkers had recently bought Scorpion helmets (one EXO-400, one EXO-700--I really can't tell the difference between them), also both in matte finish, so I was interested to compare their helmets to mine. First observation: The matte finish on the Scorpions is a paint versus the HJC's matte plastic, and after a few months of abuse my coworkers' helmets showed some pretty visible mars in the paint. My HJC, despite not always being babied, looks still almost flawless, the only sign of wear a small pock in the plastic that doesn't disrupt the solid gray coloring. I was feeling pretty good about choosing the HJC.

<div class="pull-quote">I was feeling pretty good about choosing the HJC</div>

Until I took a closer look at the insides of the Scorpions. The liner in the HJC is decent, if not slightly scratchy, but inside the Scorpions is a very slick fabric that's definitely nicer to the touch. The Scorpions, too, boast anti-fog visors--I had to buy a separate breath guard for my HJC to make it usable in temperatures below 60--and generally feel sturdier.

So when I got the opportunity to buy an anthracite-gloss EXO-400 for a <em>very</em> reasonable price, I ordered it, sight-unseen, figuring that at the worst I'd use it as a second helmet for a passenger. I've since adopted it as my main helmet, though it hasn't made the HJC obsolete.

<!--raw--><div class="photo-frame">

<a href="http://thesundaybe.st/media/helmet_03.jpg"><img src="http://thesundaybe.st/media/helmet_03.jpg" title="Scorpion EXO-400 with stock (useless) breathguard"></a>

</div><!--/raw-->

Despite buying the EXO-400 in a size medium, it fits me considerably tighter than the small CL-SP, and the tighter fit is something I've grown to appreciate. The fit difference is mostly in the cheeks, where the Scorpion snugly squishes my face while the HJC loosely but securely covers my dome. The tight fit of the Scorpion also contributes to lower ambient noise, better muffling the bike's engine note and other surrounding noises. However, the Scorpion does kick up more wind noise and the vents whistle at speed, so I can't conclude that it's actually a quieter helmet--it's more muted, but it generates more of its own noise.

<div class="pull-quote">Build quality definitely favors the Scorpion</div>

Build quality definitely favors the Scorpion. The feeling of sturdiness I got from handling my coworkers' helmets is even more apparent when wearing the lid. The visor's plastic is softer than the HJC's, so it clicks up and down with less clatter, and closes more solidly. The HJC does have a locking mechanism on the visor to keep it down in extreme wind, though I've never needed to use it and have likewise never had a problem with the non-locking Scorpion visor.

The anti-fog visor of the Scorpion is pretty impressive in most conditions, resisting stoplight fog-ups in all but misty weather. Though interestingly, the Scorpion seems to guide foggy breath directly onto my sunglasses while the same shades seem unaffected under the HJC. And despite the excellent anti-fog of the visor under most conditions, in recent foggy/misty weather the mighty Scorpion plastic adopts a smeary, Vaseline quality, even while moving with the vents fully opened--a scary situation. The CL-SP with the (optional) breath guard is virtually fog-proof in any situation, so I've resorted to using it until the weather clears up. Or until I get a <a href="http://www.respro.com/products/racing/road-racing/foggy_mask/">Respro Foggy Mask</a> to beef up the Scorpion's fog resistance.

In ventilation I'd give the advantage to the HJC. Not that it's every really hot enough around here that I notice much, but the lackluster performance of the Scorpion in the fog has me wondering if the vents on that helmet do anything but make noise. The fit of the HJC is also more comfortable for my head shape, even if the materials inside aren't as cush'. I noticed immediately when wearing the Scorpion that the head shape near the forehead is a lot tighter than the HJC (not in cushioning but in the shape of the inner shell), but it'd never been a problem until I took <a href="http://thesundaybe.st/adventure/panoramic-highway-ride/">a longish ride</a> with the helmet and felt a serious pressure point that forced me to pull over at one point. I don't fault the Scorpion for this--it's simply a matter of head shape, and mine's not completely compatible with the helmet. But for 99% of my riding, I still prefer the EXO.

<!--raw--><div class="photo-frame">

<a href="http://thesundaybe.st/media/helmet_01.jpg"><img src="http://thesundaybe.st/media/helmet_01.jpg"></a>
<a href="http://thesundaybe.st/media/helmet_04.jpg"><img src="http://thesundaybe.st/media/helmet_04.jpg"></a>

</div><!--/raw-->

Some other quick comparisons: A mirrored visor for the HJC ran me just over $30 while a mirrored Scorpion visor cost $50; The external shape of the HJC I find more attractive, though it also appears larger and gives me a bit of a bobble head (maybe due to the matte finish versus the slimming gloss of the Scorpion); The Scorpion has a very handy strip of fabric on the D-ring that makes it easier to unbuckle; Vents on the HJC are much easier to operate with gloved fingers; Switching visors is much easier on the HJC, though the Scorpion's visor locks look nicer; I like that Scorpion is an American company.

If I had to give up one helmet to keep the other, I'd hang onto the Scorpion EXO-400. The main advantage I get with the HJC is the fog performance, though that's only with the breath guard that I bought separately. Were I to give the Scorpion the benefit of an additional breath guard, I've no doubt it'd perform as well as the HJC in misty weather and would likely put the HJC on permanent pillion duty. The HJC has other advantages--biggest among them the lower wind noise and easier visor switching--but the sturdy feel and craftsmanship of the EXO add a pleasantness to gearing up that the HJC just doesn't have, like the difference of riding in a brilliantly solid Bavarian motorcar versus a tinny rental econo-box. You could argue that the CL-SP has more practical advantages (like useful vents), but I don't miss them in the EXO like I miss the quality of the Scorpion when relegated to wearing the HJC.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>The training wheels stigma</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you've never read <a HREF="http://www.bikemagazine.co.uk/"><em>Bike</em></a> you owe it to yourself to pick up an issue (Borders imports them from the UK). I've burned through about five issues now and it really is inspiring material for anyone that loves their bike and the possibilities of what you can do on two wheels. I wrote <em>Bike</em> the following letter at the end of October, mostly in hopes of getting a free subscription but also because it's something that'd been on my mind lately. And for the record, I've nothing against upgrading to faster machines--I drive a 400 hp car, but it's not because I'm expected to.

<h2>The Letter</h2>

<blockquote>

No one expected me to upgrade to a turbobrick when I drove a hand-me-down Volvo 240GL, but it seems everyone is waiting for me to toss out my 250cc Ninja and grow up to a 600cc supersport, which will in years become useless and necessarily replaced by a literbike, a 'Busa, preferably turbocharged.

I've now over 4,000 miles on my little Ninja and am still wondering why I'd ever <em>need</em> anything faster. <em>Want</em> something faster? Sure. I'd also love to put a Koenigsegg in my garage.

But I guess a CCX costs a half a fortune and a GSX-R can be had for under ten grand. Which brings me to this loose conclusion: The relatively low cost of entry to superbike performance has bred a gotta-upgrade mentality in the motorbiking community that urges bikers onto faster and faster machines.

While I won't insist my Ninjette is capable of everything, spirited riding down Skyline to Alice's and around Mount Tamalpais via the Panoramic Highway reveals to me that a 250cc bike is capable of much more than public roads can safely throw at it.

So what's with the peer urgency to graduate, as if I'm plodding around on training wheels? Even my dad, who did his biking in the '70s, manages to quiz me about upgrading every time I get him on the phone. If it weren't for the seductive Street Triple, I'd be more interested in sampling different sorts of bikes--cruisers, motards, adventure--before moving vertically in the sportbike arena.<!--more-->

Though I find nothing wrong with wanting to go faster, I'm struck that my own mentality is such a minority one. Away from the track, supersports are a waste. So's a Ferrari, but then no one thinks you're a girl or a novice just because you're not driving one.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I must agree with the "gotta-go-faster'n-bigger" mentality, since I am afflicted by the same, albeit worse than some.

Years ago, I was the proud owner of a 1975 Norton Commando 850. I owned all 51 horsepower, oil leaks and electrical tomfoolery associated with '70s era Britbikes. Suspension was optional, braking was not. Whatever is on Britbikes of that vintage, 'brakes" is not the operative word. "Hope" is more like it.

One day, I decided that 110 miles per hour on a blind mountain sweeper was for sleep-walkers, not an adrenaline junky like me. Out goes the Norton, in comes the Honda crotch-rocket 1000000000000000000RR. My first dose of reality was administered by an insurance salesperson.  "The premium is high because of the 'ARE-ARE' at the end of your bike's model number. People crash or die on those bikes," the droning voice informed me. No matter, I could forget about the fifteen-fold uptick in insurance fees as I dragged my knee in a blur of silver and red plastic, magnesium cases, and GP-inspired technology dripping off every millimeter of my new mechanical samurai.

The horsepower of the RC-51 is nearly triple that of the wheezing, cast-iron mill of the old Norton, yet my eyes are already straying. Not enough juice. I saw that Ghost Rider guy in Sweden hitting 320 Km/hour and hell, if he can wring that kind of rush out of a GSXR-1000, why couldn't I?

Yep. The need for speed is endless.]]></wp:comment_content>

				<title>Ninja 250 v the freeway</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The most common question I get with regard to the Ninja 250 is how well it tackles <em>the freeway</em>. I had doubts myself, and I got the bike with the understanding that I'd be doing mostly city riding. Any unpleasant exertion from the freeway would be only an occasional annoyance since I planned to rarely hit the superslab.

I actually avoided riding freeways for the bike's first 1,000 miles or so, partly because the freeway was sort of intimidating but mostly because I wanted to wait for the engine to break in before subjecting it to a steady rpm. My first few freeway trips were short rides to work when I was late--my usual route takes me on some fun city roads but takes about twice as long as the local freeways--but it wasn't until I had to go about forty miles south of the city that I gained real confidence in the bike's freeway capability.

<div class="video-frame"><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/2239499?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="900" height="679" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>

I took that confidence and finally rode from San Francisco to Sacramento (and back), 200+ miles round. The trip, one way, takes roughly an hour and forty-five minutes at 75-80 mph via 101 N to I-80 E. It's a familiar ride (I've family near Sacramento), but also a pretty boring one. In my car, I can relax and cruise mindlessly. I sort of took that relaxation for granted before I set out to make the trip on my bike.<!--more-->

You can't really ever relax on a motorcycle in traffic, especially at 80 mph on freeways that CalTrans is halfway through tearing up.

I quite enjoyed the first hour of the trip and was thoroughly impressed by the bike. There's one massive hill as 80 passes by Vallejo that had me worried when I ran the ride through my head the day before. In my old Volvo, I'd have to floor it, the automatic transmission would kick down a gear and the car struggled to maintain 70. It wasn't a huge problem because most cars get slowed by the hill, often chugging down to 60 mph or slower. I imagined I'd have to downshift to fifth on the Ninja, maybe even fourth, to avoid slowing to a crawl and getting run over by some a-hole in a GTO.

<div class="pull-quote">The Ninja easily stormed the hill in a gear too high</div>

As I approached the hill, I got even more concerned--traffic had backed up at the freeway interchange at the base of the hill and I wasn't able to build up any momentum to carry me up the mountain. But as the interchange traffic cleared, the bike just pushed up the hill in the clear right lane. The uphill acceleration definitely exceeded my expectations and when I reached the top of the hill and went to click into sixth gear I found that I was already there. The Ninja easily stormed the hill in a gear too high.

I never once had to downshift for power on the trip. At 80 mph in sixth gear, the bike's turning a little under 10,000 rpm which puts it solidly in its powerband so keeping up (and passing) freeway traffic is never a problem. Any doubts I had about the 249cc engine were obliterated by that ride.

<div class="pull-quote">The 250 has enough juice to keep up with traffic even at speeds in excess of the limit</div>

Still, the second half of the ride was miserable. It was September in the Sacramento valley, which means 100 degree temps and I was, as always, in full gear. The short wheelbase and light weight of the bike combined with the stiff suspension were hell on the chopped-up pavement (I-80 was really in a bad way, probably still is knowing how quickly CalTrans works). And the ride was about 45 minutes too long for comfort. By the time I got to Sacramento, I wanted nothing to do with riding the bike but still had the return leg to do later that day. Mercifully, the ride home was cooler, but still less than pleasant.

I learned valuable lessons about riding the Ninja 250 on the freeway that day. I learned that power is not a valid concern--the bike has more than enough juice to keep up with traffic even at speeds in excess of the speed limit. Even still, I also learned that long freeway trips on the Ninja aren't fun. The riding is boring, the ride quality is punishing.

For typical commutes, the little Ninja is perfectly comfortable on the freeway but when it comes to distance touring there are other bikes better suited (I don't suspect a 600cc or bigger sportbike would've been any better). I've taken day-long rides on back roads and coastal highways without discomfort, but 80 mph and choppy, boring pavement did me in after less than two hours. If I make another trip to Sacramento, it'll be via more interesting roads, even if it takes twice as long. And, <em>lord'av'mercy</em>, in temperatures below 90.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Digging dirt</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[My dad tried to get me into dirt bikes as a kid. He once asked me to kickstart his 500--my foot slipped off the kickstarter, it whipped up and tore into the back of my heel. Another time, a family friend rode over on his manual-shift ATV and my dad tried to get me to operate the clutch--I ended up flipping the quad (with my dad and me on it) and bending the handlebars out of shape, a story my dad delightedly retells to this day. And I remember my dad frequently urging me to save up for a dirt bike of my own, but I was, as a kid, more interested in PlayStation, and Jet Moto was a good enough approximation.

<div class="pull-quote">I was more interested in PlayStation, and Jet Moto was good enough</div>

Fast forward ten years to this weekend, and my dad finally got me on one of his dirt bikes. I was in his neck of the woods for an early Thanksgiving and my lil' brother (four years old) tugged me down to the garage to show off the motorcycle he rides with Dad. It's a '70s Yamaha TT500, at least thirty-years-old but shows its age well despite being covered in a fair bit of dried mud. I fiddled with the controls a bit. Kill switch is on the left handle, and the clutch is so stiff when the bike is sitting that I thought it had to be a brake lever. An hour later, my dad rolled it out of the garage, kicked it to life, and did a warm-up lap down the road to loosen the clutch for me.

I confess a bit of apprehension when I first straddled the bike. The controls on the old bike are not nearly as nice and easy to use as the Ninja's. I've only ever ridden 250cc bikes (my own and the MSF Rebel). I've never ridden on dirt. I didn't have my gear. Or any gear, for that matter, not even a borrowed helmet.

I took it <em>very</em> slow to start, staying in first gear up the driveway to the dirt road that connects my dad's abode with distant civilization. First surprise: The bike is amazingly easy to control in low-speed maneuvers. Despite my awkward handle of the bike, I was instantly making super slow u-turns without sticking a leg out, which was especially unexpected with my complete lack of experience in gravel. Maybe gravel makes slow stuff easier than street--I've really no idea--but I was, if I do say, impressed with my ability to not drop the bike during certain maneuvers.<!--more-->

It wasn't long before I started kicking through the gears. Though the clutch had softened up, the gear lever remained very stiff. It takes some very deliberate presses to click up and down gears, which would be hell on the streets but wasn't too bad for the lazy dirt riding I was doing. Not sure how fast I was going, but I'd be surprised if I ever broke 30 mph. The engine's got gobs of torque so it pulls great from low revs, but it sounds hysterically stressed as the revs build and the power doesn't seem to match the noise levels. No tach, so I don't even know if I was short shifting or beating it up, though considering my nervous restraint I assume the former.

<div class="pull-quote">The bike just rolls over everything without drama</div>

The best part of the bike is how it kills the roads' imperfections. I was standing on the pegs to let my legs absorb a bit of washboard but found such effort completely unnecessary. The bike just rolls over everything without drama. Rolling down the same road in my car is like riding an ancient wooden roller coaster (at all of 15 mph), but those imperfections in the dirt were erased by the Yamaha.

After getting used to the gear lever and comfortable with the off-road competence of the suspension, I was having a blast riding back and forth, up and down the road. I wanted to push it harder, find out what'd happen if I deliberately spun the rear tire in a turn, or maybe find a lump of dirt to jump from. I didn't do any of that--guarded only by jeans, a t-shirt and a pair of New Balance 992s, my riding confidence hit a ceiling pretty quickly.

But my dad succeeded in something he'd been trying for as long as I can remember. He not only got me onto a dirt bike, but also got me wanting one of my own.

				<title>Justifying hysteria, the cost of a 250R</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Rumor has it, the new Ninja 250 is a bit popular and demand has driven dealer asking prices stupid. A shame, as at MSRP plus tax and <em>reasonable</em> dealer fees the bike is a great bargain. Prospective buyers are rightfully concerned by the ballooning prices and question if the bike's worth it. I can't speak for everyone's case, but this is my take on the sour subject.

I first looked at moto prices on Kawasaki's site back in mid-'07 after a coworker inspired my curiosity. Back then--already talking about 2007 as if it wasn't yesterday--Kawasaki listed a new Ninja 250 for $2,999, a price that floored me. Had I known bikes were that affordable, I might've considered riding earlier. But then had I known a new model, a price hike and Wii-caliber demand (hysteria?) would soon make $2,999 a pipe dream,  my optimism might've deflated just as quickly as it hit.

<a href="http://thesundaybe.st/media/ninja_garage_01.jpg"><img src="http://thesundaybe.st/media/ninja_garage_01.jpg"></a>

</div><!--/raw-->

I'm a bit of a bargain hunter but also unwilling to settle for less than what I want, a pair of traits that generally keeps me from buying much at all; I'm adverse to compromise and content to have nothing. I'd decided on the 2008 Ninja 250 before doing any market research, and when I did start talking to dealers in February I almost lost hope. One dealer had a waiting list but would take deposits (not the best situation for negotiation), another had a green bike in stock but tried to squeeze me for $5,500 out the door. I haggled the latter down to $4,500, with $4,000-even my aim. I left that battle disappointed, uncompromised and with nothing.<!--more-->

<div class="pull-quote">I'm adverse to compromise and content to have nothing</div>

I spent the next week dialing dealers as far away as Roseville and Placerville (travel distance: two hours, plus) with no one interested in trading a bike for less than $4,500 cash. One dealer eventually called back with $4,300 and I was tempted but the color (green) and location (Oakland) were enough to keep me from jumping on the best price I'd managed to wring from Northern California dealers.

The weekend after, I visited another local shop which had called me to advertise the blue bike they'd just rolled onto the showroom floor. I didn't have much hope for negotiation, more wanted to see the <em>candy plasma blue</em> in the flesh (I picked blue as my favorite based on online photos). The shop also had a leftover 2007 model which I reluctantly started to haggle on. Not that a pre-'08 250 is a bad bike--in some ways it's better than mine--but to me it was compromise. And not trying to sound resentful, but that dealer was ridiculous with the asking price on the year-old model; after nearly an hour of back-and-forth, the lowest otd price I could manage was $3,600...on a leftover $2,999 bike.

Seeing that that negotiation was going nowhere, I parlayed my rapport with the salesman into discussion of the blue 2008. Post (too) much deliberation, we agreed on an otd price of $4,300, matching the earlier offer but with a local bike in the color I wanted.

Any buyer's remorse I felt afterward--having <em>compromised</em> and not gotten the $4,000 deal I wanted--was gradually assuaged as anecdotal otd prices climbed. As gas prices senselessly soared and the summer loomed, demand for the 250R escalated and so with it prices. The insane offers of $5,500 I turned down in February looked genius in June when Craigslist postings offered low-sided samples for even more. A $500 hike in the MSRP for the '09 model makes my reluctant $4,300 sound like the best deal imaginable.

<div class="pull-quote">Riders who buy new bikes are 70% more likely to have a crash</div>

But while the rising price of the new Ninja 250 gives me mental relief, it's not the reason I'm happy I bought the bike when I did. I'm happy I bought the bike because it's the bike I wanted. Every time I climb off and walk away, I can't help but glance back. The Ninja looks the part and doesn't leave me wanting for a cooler, bigger supersport--this thing's got cool in spades. After 5,000 miles of riding, I'm not looking to upgrade. Getting what I wanted means that I can be satisfied with what I have, which in the world of motorcycles--a world where riders who buy new bikes are 70% more likely to have a crash--is a healthy feeling. The improved suspension in the new model 250 will suitably give me room to grow my riding skills for years, which is more than I would have expected had I settled for a used, older bike.

I didn't buy my bike expecting to quickly turn it around for a 600RR or R6. I wanted something for keeps, something I wouldn't have to compromise. And for that, it was worth the hassle and cost of buying new. It's a bike I imagine I'll love forever. New buyers looking for a short affair are better off with a cheaper used bike--buying new and selling with a thousand miles on the clocks is stupid--but budding riders in want of a lifetime companion won't be disappointed by the 250R. Even if getting one calls for some compromise.]]></content:encoded>

If you want to keep the bike a while, I'd recommend getting the newer 250s. Better suspension and chassis makes it a more capable bike that'll give you more room to grow. If you just want something tame to start with and move to a bigger bike within a year, you're probably better off with an older 250 which you can find considerably cheaper.]]></wp:comment_content>

I did some playing with shutter speeds, aiming to give the photos a bit of background motion blur. Unfortunately, I ended up blurring pretty much everything until I switched to my fixed 50mm lens, but by then it was getting late and the subjects were fewer and far between.

I definitely learned a few things and hope to further develop my skills with more shooting excursions. Maybe next time I'll put more effort into the post-processing--for this batch, I lazily applied some canned Lightroom adjustments.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There's something coolly romantic about riding in the dead of night, and I don't mean the idea of it. It's when I'm on the empty streets, calmly counting down timed stoplights with the cold ocean air on my neck that I feel the banality of the ride give way to romance, the feeling that the moment is more than the sum of its parts.

Tonight, a gaggle of guys from work gathered at the Fireside Bar in San Francisco's Sunset district to celebrate the birthday of one of our own. After over an hour of baking in my gear against the heat of drunk bodies and flicking flames (the "Fireside" is no joke), I say my goodbyes, eager to saddle the Ninja and ride off.

<!--raw--><div class="photo-frame">

<a href="http://thesundaybe.st/media/nightrider_01.jpg"><img src="http://thesundaybe.st/media/nightrider_01.jpg"></a>

</div><!--/raw-->

It's been a while since I rode out of the Sunset at night. The city is very different at midnight, the chaotic clutter of traffic quietly tucked in for bed. Even moving between the tightly spaced stop signs on Judah, the ride is an intoxicating joy. Few cars to worry about, though always in the back of the mind the thought of some DUI with his lights off shooting through the next intersection. I treat the N-line train as an offensive tackle, slipping into the protective pocket behind it to guard against the make-believe drunks.<!--more-->

<div class="pull-quote">On a motorcycle, the road is my playground. It’s an addictive lack of limits</div>

When I hit the Great Highway and run down the coast, the romance swells. I pull over to the side of the road for a quick camera phone picture and am reminded why I love being on two wheels. In a car, I feel as if I'm merely passing <i>through</i> a given area, restricted, chained to two tons of aluminum and steel. On a motorcycle, the road is my playground, albeit amidst a war zone. I'm free to stop and change direction with the ease of walking, in any space no matter how small or crowded. Even keeping to my lane affords a freedom of movement not possible in an auto, and weaving side to side--an impromptu practice of counter-steering--satisfies my appetite for more than straight lines.

It's an addictive lack of limits. And on a cool December night, it's even better than usual.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Can&#039;t outrun winter</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Winter's catching up with me. Ever since June's solstice, I've been dreading the shorter days and weather that'll keep me cooped up and off the bike. The weather reports said there was a good chance of rain last night and an even better chance today. When I woke up to blue skies, I wondered if this morning might be my last chance for a ride, my last chance before the sun goes into hibernation for the year, the sky soaks the landscape and all life's joy succumbs to the sucking black hole of winter. In earnest, I geared up and in unprecedented fashion was out the door and on the road before 10:30 AM.

My goal was to ride <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&saddr=CA-1&daddr=37.374795,-122.265472+to:CA-1&hl=en&geocode=FUK3OwIdos-z-A%3B%3BFRyvOwIdYc6z-A&mra=dme&mrcr=0&mrsp=1&sz=12&via=1&sll=37.388981,-122.259979&sspn=0.146483,0.235863&ie=UTF8&ll=37.399074,-122.327957&spn=0.292926,0.471725&z=11">The Loop</a>, stop somewhere for photos, and outrun the oncoming weather system by making it home before getting wet. Anticipating that it'd be cold, I wore top and bottom thermal layers under my gear but even early in the ride, tracing Highway 1 through Pacifica, I was starting to doubt that it was enough. The coast is cool during the warmer seasons, but when weather turns frigid the ocean air tends to resist chilling more so than inland mountain back roads. I feared what cold might welcome me later.

The second sign that I was about to fail in my attempt to outrun the weather was a bit more subtle. On the approach to 92, other motorcycles were few and far, far between. Highway 1 is usually teeming with motos but not today. Bicyclists outnumbered motorcycles ten-to-one, a ratio that persisted on the back roads. To wit, I crossed paths with only two motorcycles on Skyline, and just two more on the way back to Highway 1.<!--more-->

Where Skyline starts at 92, the sky's open and the road winds uphill. But it soon dives down the mountain as the forest canopy closes tighter and tighter, encroaching on and eventually blotting out the graying sky. In moderate weather, the scenery is fantastic, but today the landscape conspired to freeze off my fingers--among other things. Deeper into the hills, trickles of water glossed the roads. I was stuck behind some slow drivers, but with slippery asphalt and numb hands to work with, the slower pace was actually welcome.

</div><!--/raw-->

I pulled into Alice's parking lot when I reached the intersection of 35 and 84, desperate for a chance to warm my paws. I stuck my hands between gaps in the Ninja's fairings for warmth and cupped the end of the muffler. A couple of notes on warming: 1) The muffler is a good source of heat to warm your hands as the can gets pretty warm but won't burn you through gloves, but 2) the exhaust pipe before the muffler is <i>not</i> a good part of the bike to touch, even if you're covered in leather. Ask me how I know.

<div class="pull-quote">You can’t outrun winter. But you can outlast it</div>

Four or five guys on sport/standard bikes had arrived just before me and were off their bikes sharing anecdotes of weather. I asked one of them which direction he'd come from, hoping to confirm that my plan to take 84 back to Highway 1 would bring me warmer weather. But he also came by 35 and advised against running 84, suggesting it'd be colder since it's nearer the ocean. But he had a foreign accent and I've lived in California for more than twenty years. Surely I know better.

It'd be quality irony if my wisdom proved wrong, but I was right. 84 wasn't afflicted with the same wicked chill of 35. Even better, 84 was dry. There's really something special about 84; the flow of the turns and camber of the tarmac inspire infinite confidence. Though I did cross a few stretches of 84 mired in mud tracked in by trucks from the soupy shoulders, I'd still have to advise that if you're under-dressed in the San Francisco Bay Area, in mid-December, running away from an imminent rainstorm, ride Highway 84 instead of Skyline.

Or stay home. You can't outrun winter. But you can outlast it.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Hail to the Ninja</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Short story shorter, the forecast called for rain today but it was dry in the morning and I wanted to ride so I could pick up (and affix) the personalized license plate waiting for me at the DMV. The weather was clear all day...until I left work to go home.

I didn't realize it was pouring rain until I stepped outside the office at roughly 7:00 PM. I ran back inside to wrap up my laptop in plastic bags to keep it dry inside my backpack and by the time I was on the bike and ready to ride the cold rain turned to pelting hail. <i>This'll be fun</i>.

The hail was pretty heavy, but as it had just started there wasn't much build up on the road, just barely enough to leave tire tracks behind me. I kept very slow, taking to extremes advice I'd read regarding riding in bad weather. Smooth with everything, especially the brakes. On the morning ride into work, though it wasn't raining the roads were wet and even careful braking at under 5 mph was enough to lock up my rear for a quick second before stopping.

<div class="pull-quote">Picking efficient racing lines is a useful skill when traction is scarce</div>

I usually ride home via surface streets, but tonight opted for the freeway for a handful of reasons: 1) The freeway is about ten minutes faster; 2) My usual route takes me over a mountain that's cold enough when I'm not soaking wet; 3) More traffic on the freeway means less chance for hail to grow into significant piles; 4) There's not much resembling turns on the freeway, which is quite good when you're afraid to lean over (I was). I wasn't concerned about speeds--San Francisco traffic slows to a relative crawl when the roads get wet, so I didn't get a chance to exceed 55 mph until after the hail had gone back to wherever it's been hiding these past five years in which I never saw hail in the Bay Area.<!--more-->

When the downpour was thickest, I tried to follow in the tracks left behind by cars ahead of me. As the speeds picked up, it was harder to do so while leaving a safe buffer between the Ninja and the automobiles. As suggested earlier, stopping in the rain can prove a delicate operation, so I left plenty of stopping distance--and indeed distance all around me--to minimize any need for abrupt maneuvers.

<a href="http://thesundaybe.st/media/hailtotheninja_02.jpg"><img src="http://thesundaybe.st/media/hailtotheninja_02.jpg" title="The blue line represents the path a car would typically follow. Taking a more gradual line through a corner--the red line here--will let you get 'round the bend without exceeding the traction limits of the road"></a>

</div><!--/raw-->

Picking efficient racing lines is a fun game when weather permits speed, but also a useful skill when traction is scarce. While you're limited to following the lines of the road in a car, a motorcycle's narrow track lets you carve wider arcs through the same bends by using the full width of your lane. In racing, using the full width of the course lets drivers/riders go faster by effectively extracting the maximum amount of traction possible through the curve. While going fast shouldn't be a goal on wet roads in traffic, maximizing traction <i>should</i> be near the top of your short list of immediate concerns. A sharp turn requires more lean and leads to more risk of a slip and fall. A blunt corner needs less lean and keeps you as straight as possible, even through a bend, both helpful qualities in low traction conditions.

I made it home okay, no falls, no slips. My laptop still works; turns out the backpack doesn't get a chance to gather much rain as my body and face absorb most of it when moving forward. I might not have had the dubious pleasure of riding in the hail had I not rushed to the vanity plate, but the completed bike and riding experience were worth the squeeze.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Farewell, 2008</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It wasn't until midway through today's ride that I realized it'd be my last adventure of 2008. Not that it's terribly significant, but the ride felt different. The beginning of this year inspired my interest in motorcycling, so sending off 2008 with a farewell ride seemed fitting, even nostalgic.

</div><!--/raw-->

I've seen Stage Road mentioned on <a href="http://www.bayarearidersforum.com/forums/">the local moto-forum</a> but never really wondered where it is. Turns out I've passed it numerous times on my joyrides east of Half Moon Bay. On Christmas, I had a conversation with my mom about fun riding roads and she mentioned "a road between San Gregorio and Pescadero" that she thought I'd enjoy. I looked it up and saw that Stage runs just off of my weekend favorite, Highway 84. Recent mention of Stage Road on the Bay Area Riders Forum further piqued my interest, especially all this nonsense discussion about <a href="http://www.bayarearidersforum.com/forums/showthread.php?t=278234">goat trails</a>. I had no idea what constitutes a goat trail but was intent on learning.

<div class="google-map"><iframe frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;source=s_d&amp;saddr=Pescadero+Creek+Rd&amp;daddr=37.272345,-122.386751+to:CA-84+E%2FLa+Honda+Rd%2FSan+Gregorio+Rd&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=FS5qOAIduJW0-A%3B%3BFQKQOQId0Ie0-A&amp;mra=dpe&amp;mrcr=0&amp;mrsp=1&amp;sz=14&amp;via=1&amp;sll=37.261826,-122.388039&amp;sspn=0.037434,0.059395&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=37.261826,-122.388039&amp;spn=0.037434,0.059395&amp;output=embed"></iframe></div>

<div class="video-frame"><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/2713468?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="900" height="506" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>

Almost immediately, Stage casts off its painted marking, crossing a wide bridge before narrowing to bare strip of asphalt that winds around and up a great many shrubby cliffs. The surface is pretty raw, textured like a Jackson Pollock painting covered in cellophane, and the earth surrounding the road liberally spills onto the asphalt. It's not a road I'd call fast, but it's awesome all the same. The turns offer a variety of blind sweepers and uphill hairpins, and the vacant nature of Stage makes it possible to enjoy the full width of the tarmac, provided sight lines confirm there's nothing to run into ahead. I crossed paths with one other two-wheeler and only a few autos during my ride down and back the length of Stage between 84 and Pescadero.

I had to slow for a young deer that scampered off the road as I rounded a blind bend, doing my best to stand on the pegs to allow my legs to absorb bumps the Ninja's sporty suspension can't. Stage carves through some farmey land with far more animals--mostly sheep and cows--than people and buildings. Whenever I venture to new places south of me I'm struck by how rural areas in such close proximity of The City &#153; can be. I find the unmolested landscapes comforting. Though I've lived the better part of the last decade among modern civilization, I grew up in relative wilderness, with neighbors whose residences measured in acres, not square feet. This place takes me back, amplifying the hazy sentiments of the last day of another year.

After a particularly sweet left-hander that neatly curls 180 degrees uphill, the route climbs quickly and overlooks the past turns. I didn't appreciate the dangerous drop just a couple of feet off the pavement until the return trip when I hugged the opposite side of the road. The view from the ledge (see photo at top) is breath-taking, the distant clouds casting crawling shadows over the brown and green earth below. The moment completes one of the driving fantasies that compels me to motorcycling, the ideal of minimalistic adventure: simply me on my modest steed in the middle of the wide world. I don't need anything more than this.

</div><!--/raw-->

The trip was the most fulfilling diversion I've taken since my very first escape into back road twisties, yielding the familiar sensation of discovering new challenges offered by public roads. I can only imagine how awesome Stage might be on a motard. Perhaps some day I'll find out.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Greetings,

Nice video of the ride, lots of two-lane country ribbons splitting farms--just like this one in your video--in Pennsylvania. Thought you were taking me on a trip through my own memories. My NYC buddies and myself would spend weekends thrashing through towns like Port Clinton, Kutztown, Hamburg, Shoemakersville, Fritztown.

The area was Berks County and it was filled with twisties running along and through the Appalachian, stringers through German/Dutch farms with pure, straight fields in corn, jumping up down in the fields, straining to catch us, catching the last of the summer night's light--all day affairs, much like yours. Congrats on the making the most of your experience.

Scott
Harrisonville, Missouri]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you don't happen to live in the better half of the Left Coast then forgive my boasting, but the weather we've had this past week is unbelievably perfect. Unbelievable in that <a href="http://thesundaybe.st/adventure/cant-outrun-winter/">just weeks ago</a> temperatures were verifiably freezing with reports of snow on familiar routes south of me. Unbelievable because the middle of January is not supposed to bring clear skies, high 60s Fahrenheit and dry, faultless tarmac. Today's ride felt like cheating. I was getting away with something unbelievable, unfair, and intended to make the most of it.

I wasn't alone, as bikers on all sorts came out to play. Nothing told of the true season, weather and traffic reminiscing summer life in staggering contrast to last month's sad void. A common sense of bliss waxed palpable as every rider I crossed seemed thankful for the day. The weather affected even stoic Harley hooligans, who on multiple occasions initiated waves with my candy blue baby (on any other day, I'd typically need to wave first to elicit a response from these bandanna'd bad-asses).

I planned a run of <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&saddr=CA-1&daddr=37.374795,-122.265472+to:CA-1&hl=en&geocode=FUK3OwIdos-z-A%3B%3BFRyvOwIdYc6z-A&mra=dme&mrcr=0&mrsp=1&sz=12&via=1&sll=37.388981,-122.259979&sspn=0.146483,0.235863&ie=UTF8&ll=37.399074,-122.327957&spn=0.292926,0.471725&z=11">The Loop</a> and sooner-than-hoped found myself at the Skywood Trading Post across the street from Alice's. The clock had barely ticked past one o'clock before I reached the halfway point of my intended ride. To extend my alone time with the bike, I grabbed a drink and browsed the parade of bikes parked in the vicinity. I love the diversity of bikes in the Bay Area, capable of ad-hoc displays like today's STP and Alice's parking lots that shame dealer showrooms.<!--more-->

A sharp-dressed Harley Nightster caught my eye, and a few bikes over, its new brother, the XR1200, was getting a once-over from another admirer. In the opposite lot, a pair of classic-reeking Triumphs found each other, one a pristine new Bonneville, the other a 50-year-old bona fide vintage, seeping character. The owner told me he purposely doesn't wash it because the grime adds to the bike's "mystique," and I'm inclined to agree. I am not a very social creature, but it doesn't take much more than a lusting glance at another bike to extort heart-felt gushing from its owner.

My beverage consumed, I found myself facing the unwanted ride home, like a child reluctantly heeding his mother's call to come in after a day's play. I don't anticipate for some time another day of weather like today's, and knew as much at that moment. So with little guilt, I ignored the make-believe parental plea and ran further south down 35 toward 9.

<div class="google-map"><iframe frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;source=s_d&amp;saddr=N+Main+St&amp;daddr=Big+Basin+Way%2FCA-9+to:37.324578,-122.399368+to:CA-1&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=FQq4OwIdwtyz-A%3BFehQOAIdzze4-A%3B%3BFeSmOwId_s2z-A&amp;mra=dme&amp;mrcr=1&amp;mrsp=2&amp;sz=12&amp;via=2&amp;sll=37.353512,-122.341347&amp;sspn=0.146552,0.234489&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=37.372886,-122.268219&amp;spn=0.293028,0.468979&amp;output=embed&amp;s=AARTsJriFxhQDyehiSwslHeidFTjlm7AjQ"></iframe></div>

Motorcyclists aren't the only folks wise to the magic of these mountain roads. The enticing turns lure out the best of the Bay Area's usually depressing automotive collection. Lancer Evolutions and Miatas are a dime a dozen in this setting, and even super cars seem commonplace. Today's ride brought me near a new Exige and a 599 Fiorano, and my decision to venture further south down 35 yielded a game of chase with a bright orange Tesla Roadster bearing manufacturer's plates. A trio of modded Mustangs (marked with garish <a href="http://www.koolstangs.net">Koolstangs</a> decals) shared a popular vista just off 9 as I pulled in for a photo-op. The owners may have confirmed some Top Gear-perpetuated stereotypes, but despite the tasteless stickers I couldn't help but admire the intoxicating V8 burble as the ponies departed.

After burning a solid twenty minutes absorbing the scenery of the vista, I felt satisfied to turn home. I did manage to prolong the day with an impromptu lunch in a Montara cafe and a supply stop at the local moto shop (the bike just turned 6,000 miles and wants fresh oil). At half past five I was back in San Francisco, grateful to have spent a January day with my bike.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Motomalism</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img SRC="http://thesundaybe.st/media/motomalism.jpg">

It's rarely a conscious direction, but I've always been attracted to minimalism. As evidence of the subliminal draw, it wasn't until after a month of <strike>planning</strike> dreaming this trip that the theme became a deliberate objective. So know that while motomalism is about exploring the nation with roughly as little as possible, the minimalism is not contrived. It is me. I wouldn't do this any other way.

The inspiration for the trip is simple to trace back. I began reading Bike magazine in June of 2008, and the rag's fantastic authors made an immediate impact. Motorcycling became more than a fun way to get to work. Bike opened my eyes to the possibilities of travel and exploration, of tearing down the nebulous intimidation of unfamiliar places. On two wheels, behind the tinted shield of a full-face helmet, the world is my playground.

Credit goes also to Charley and Ewan, Nick Sanders, and Malcolm Smith. They've been around the world and I wanted to go with them. I wanted to tour Europe on a rented bike, go exotic places named Africa. But that thinking gave way to my natural pragmatism. Why fly the Atlantic to find new places on borrowed wheels when I've never even ventured east of Texas?

There are forty American states I've never been, and surely there's as much worth seeing within them than in any other of Earth's continents. The United States may not possess the cultural history of Europe and Asia, but Crater Lake, Niagara Falls and the Grand Canyon interest me far more than old buildings and microbrews. Boston is as foreign to me as Paris.

Best of all, I won't have paperwork to bother, flight schedules to keep, or other distracting clutter between me and the road. Traveling the United States is the purest and simplest option, a no-frills, legitimate adventure. Basics--naturally, subconsciously, that's what I want.

				<title>About The Sunday Best</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I started <em>The Sunday Best</em> in 2008, shortly after buying my first motorcycle and concluding that motorcycling is, by my guess, the best thing in this world.

At the time, I creatively called it <em>Ninja 250 Blog</em> and stated its purpose as washing away the intimidating mystique motorcycles have. On the outside of motorcycle culture, it appears to be about gang-banging and racing. But to me, motorcycling isn't about looking hard or going fast. It's about experiencing beautiful locales in the best way possible. It's about mastery of skill. Motorcycling is about inquisitive minds and learning. It's friendly and passionate and everyone should experience it because there's nothing better than riding a motorcycle.

In 2009, I bought a Suzuki DR-350, which wasn't a Ninja 250 at all but I still wrote about it. I knew the blog's name would have to change when I finally sold the Ninja 250. (I wouldn't have guessed that four years later I'd still be riding it).

I ride my motorcycle almost every day, but Sundays are still the best. On Sundays, Bay Area riders swarm the local hills to trot out their best machines. It's ritual, almost religious. Ergo, "The Sunday Best."

<h2>Sponsor <em>The Sunday Best</em></h2>

Contact me if you'd like to sponsor <em>The Sunday Best</em>. I'm looking for a motorcycle manufacturer with a similar mission statement -- to make motorcycling passionate and friendly -- to supply a bike that I can ride and blog about for one year. At the end of the year, I'll keep the bike and you keep rights to republish any words and photos I produce in that year, in limitless license.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The mechanics of steering a motorcycle

Go ahead and make shit up, it's not like it's a matter of life and death.

How does one steer a motorcycle? According Tim Porter, who penned a letter printed in Bike's November 2013 issue:

<blockquote>

I would say forget almost any instruction on steering. If you can ride a motorcycle, steering happens naturally. You don't push left to go left, because if you did that you'd be turning the front wheel in the wrong direction. Pushing down makes the bike lean to the left, which is what needs to happen to make the bike turn left ... In my experience, best just do what feels right.

</blockquote>

It might be the worst piece of advice I've yet read on the art of influencing the direction of a motorcycle. It is precisely wrong in every word. And while it's the first time I've read the technique boldly committed to paper, I'm sadly certain the faith is widely adopted.

Learning to properly steer a motorcycle will not take longer than an afternoon of practice and concerted attention. Yet some riders go years without bothering, a potentially dangerous oversight that escalates when their flippant technique spreads socially. Or indeed via the pages of a popular motorcycle magazine.

That's not to suggest that motorcycle steering is easily mastered. But two simple techniques require little mastery before dramatic improvements reflect in the confidence of a motorcycle rider.

<!--raw--><div class="photo-frame">

<a href="http://thesundaybe.st/media/how-to-steer.jpg"><img src="http://thesundaybe.st/media/how-to-steer.jpg"/></a>

</div><!--/raw-->

<h2>Counter steering</h2>

If you're riding a motorcycle and are not yet familiar with the term "counter steering," someone's failed you. People much smarter than me have explained the physics behind the technique, but there's no need to understand them. The basic premise will do:

<blockquote>

To steer left, push forward on the left handlebar.
To steer right, push forward on the right handlebar.

</blockquote>

Rather than attempt to explain the physics, I'm going to suggest a real-world exercise.

Find an empty two-lane road with long straights. A freeway will work, but I prefer something with a speed limit set between 45 and 55 mph.

While riding straight, loosen your grip on the handlebars so that neither hand is pushing or pulling on the bars. Keep a relaxed grip, not using the handlebars to support your weight.

Firmly -- but not abruptly -- push forward on the left handlebar. A little nudge is all that's necessary to begin leaning the bike to the left and, in turn, steering the motorcycle to the left.

Now press forward on the right handlebar to bring the bike back upright and begin leaning to the right. Alternate steering left and right, zig-zagging in your lane, to gain confidence that counter steering works. (Importantly, it works in corners, too.)

Mr. Porter suggests, "You don't push left to go left ... Pushing down makes the bike lean to the left," an assertion that's disproven with just a few minutes of testing. Repeat the exercise I outlined above, but instead of pushing forward on the bars press down on them.

I've tried it. The result is little impact on the direction of the motorcycle. Any steering initiated by pressing down on the handlebars can more accurately be attributed to minor counter steering inputs that are, by happy accident, a side effect of pushing downward on motorcycle parts that don't lever up and down.

<h2>Turn your head</h2>

"Best just do what feels right," for most people, means staring at the asphalt just feet in front of a motorcycle tire, nervously doubting the rubber's connection to the asphalt through corners. Transfixing focus on the next ten feet is natural, and it significantly affects steering.

It affects steering in a bad way. Contrary to Mr. Porter's assertion, "natural" tendencies are often wrong.

Fight nature, and force your eyes through the end of a turn. Turn your heard, point your nose in the direction you want your motorcycle to go. Lift your gaze from the asphalt directly before your tire. The asphalt will still be there, I promise.

The benefits of looking through a turn -- rather than staring down the front tire -- are multitudinous. Allow me to enumerate the two that come to mind.

<ol>
	<li>You will see debris and other road obstacles further ahead of time. Spotting a patch of dirt ten feet forward does little good at 40 mph.</li>
	<li>While focused on the conclusion of the bend, you will make more confident, less nervous steering inputs. A ten-foot stare is constantly introduced to new and distracting information. Look forward, take in the entirety of the corner and inform your steering with that.</li>
</ol>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On March 16, 2008 I completed the Motorcycle Safety Foundation's Basic RiderCourse. I had never ridden a motorcycle before the course, but passed the final test missing only a few points for crossing the boundary of the U-turn box. On March 17, 2008, I endeavored to ride my sparkling new 2008 Ninja 250 home from the dealership.

San Francisco isn't a large city, the ride from the dealer to my apartment comprising a mere ten miles of surface streets. Though to put that brief ten miles into perspective, I noted that after completing the MSF course the trip odometer on my borrowed Rebel had just barely ticked off twelve miles over two days of "riding" (more like "idling in a playground"). The ten miles between the dealer and home, insignificant now, were at the time intensely intimidating.

On the bike, out front of the dealer, I repeatedly stalled the motor for probably ten minutes, struggling to take off between clusters of traffic. The slight uphill slant of the road was enough to give me fits, though getting started proved to be the only major hurdle. By the time I'd reached the first stop light, I recall marveling at how comfortable the fit of the Ninja was in contrast to the comparatively awkward saddle of the MSF Rebel. The Ninja's upright position, slightly canted forward over the handlebars felt at home to my body accustomed to mountain bike commuting.

<!--raw--><div class="photo-frame">

<a href="http://thesundaybe.st/media/ayear_01.jpg"><img src="http://thesundaybe.st/media/ayear_01.jpg"></a>

</div><!--/raw-->

My anxiety seemed to inconspicuously vanish--it didn't lingeringly fade, it didn't suddenly disappear, it just felt as if it'd never been. I traced the coast via the Great Highway without incident. And as I approached my apartment's drive, I rode past. Ten miles wasn't enough. I stretched the ride to twenty-some-odd miles to the office, and then enjoyed another twelve miles home. By the end of the first day with my Ninja 250, the bike had gobbled up forty miles.

<div class="pull-quote">Motorcycling is, in my estimation, the best thing in the world</div>

An unforgettable start to what would be a defining year of my life.

I didn't start riding for the lifestyle, expected it'd be a mere casual pastime. But during the past year with my Ninja, I have...

<ul>
<li>...traveled 7,500 miles...</li>
<li>...gone as far north as <a href="http://thesundaybe.st/adventure/panoramic-highway-ride/">Stinson Beach</a>...</li>
<li>...as far south as <a href="http://thesundaybe.st/adventure/took-friday-off/">Santa Cruz</a>...</li>
<li>...as far east as <a href="http://thesundaybe.st/daily-moto/ninja-250-v-the-freeway/">Sacramento</a>...</li>
<li>...and as far west as across the street (it's just beach and Pacific Ocean after that)...</li>
<li>...chased a Tesla Roadster through the Santa Cruz mountains...</li>
<li>...spent more time in <a href="http://thesundaybe.st/daily-moto/midnight-playground/">San Francisco proper</a> than I had in the previous four years of living here...</li>
<li>...worn through the stock tires after roughly 7,000 miles...</li>
<li>...had a faulty odometer replaced under warranty...</li>
<li>...run out of gas once, about a quarter mile from home...</li>
<li>...taken the car to work fewer than a dozen times...</li>
<li>...ridden home through a <a href="http://thesundaybe.st/daily-moto/hail-to-the-ninja/">hail storm</a>...</li>
<li>...changed oil four times, synthetic at the third oil change...</li>
<li>...almost dropped the bike three times, twice because I forgot to put down the kick stand...</li>
<li>...locked the rear tire three times, twice in the rain, once when a car in front of me abruptly stopped for an emergency vehicle...</li>
<li>...narrowly avoided two accidents to left-turning cages...</li>
<li>...got clipped by a Volvo in Pacifica and didn't go down...</li>
<li>...pulled zero wheelies...</li>
<li>...never dragged knee...</li>
<li>...averaged roughly 50 mpg...</li>
<li>...encouraged three friends to take MSF...</li>
</ul>

I imagine it'll all become inconsequential with time, but it feels like it's been a big, important year, and I'm glad I lived it. Motorcycling is, in my estimation, the best thing in the world.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The past week's weather has been just shy of flawless, the only absent trait being some semblance of summer warmth. Last Sunday, I took advantage of the clear skies and celebrated the shifting of the clocks an hour forward--the day that DST sets in is among my favorite of the year--with a quick ride to Alice's and Skywood Trading Post. Also delighting in the dwindling days of winter were countless other bikers swarming the Santa Cruz Mountains with me.

I optimistically planned an immediate sequel, another trip to Alice's though via new roads for the added thrill of discovery. The weather, sadly, proved less welcoming today, dipping to temperatures that I--a verifiable <i>BCB*</i>--deemed freezing. But despite chilled-stiff hands and even a few unimpressive drops from the sky, the trip into the mountains scratched my itch.

Having just run <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&saddr=CA-1&daddr=37.374795,-122.265472+to:CA-1&hl=en&geocode=FUK3OwIdos-z-A%3B%3BFRyvOwIdYc6z-A&mra=dme&mrcr=0&mrsp=1&sz=12&via=1&sll=37.388981,-122.259979&sspn=0.146483,0.235863&ie=UTF8&ll=37.399074,-122.327957&spn=0.292926,0.471725&z=11">The Loop</a>, I wanted to try something new and decided on testing Pescadero Creek Road, which branches off my favorite Highway 84 and would leave me to endure the torturous Stage Road to get back home.

Before I'd hit Pescadero, I wasted a good hour walking between the parking lots of Alice's and STP. Though today's bike turnout paled in comparison to last week's shining display, the lots weren't without some oddities. Notably, I saw a Bee Emm with a mountain bike strapped to the back, a Harley with a Budweiser tap for an oil drain, and once again spotted what I've dubbed the Death Rod, a matte black rat rod with an exposed engine, open headers, certainly-sub-legal light fixtures and a set of jaws on the front. If the thing looks scary in a parking lot, it's downright frightening as it barks down the wooded halls branching off the gravitational intersection of Highways 35 and 84.

Leaving the breathing bike show behind, I made for Pescadero Creek Road, which breaks southwest past La Honda. I didn't know what to expect of the road, and it delivered a bit of everything. At the start, it's a bit of 84 with less perfect pavement. But Pescadero soon turns narrower, turning tighter with more elevation change, and I instantly recalled <a href="http://thesundaybe.st/adventure/panoramic-highway-ride/">the Panoramic Highway</a>. Bits of Pescadero are very similar, with handsome views from mountaintops overlooking landscapes below, but the road quality's superior. And it doesn't last as long.

Curiously, Pescadero toggles between a few different ride styles, and the variety is welcome, though an abrupt road bump interrupted one of the faster sections and caught me off guard. The jump in the handlebars caused me to slightly torque the throttle, giving me a surprise jolt and a nice reminder that it's wise to ride with increased caution on unfamiliar paths.

And then Stage. I've only ridden it once before, but it left an impression. I love that road. My bike's not the best suited to the intensely textured surface, but the curves, the solitude and the scenery make it feel like home. I want to be there always. But until I can afford a dream home, photos will have to do.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've got a great friend that's soon taking the plunge into motorcycling and I feel a responsibility to share my wisdom--a <em>full</em> year of it--to prepare him for the mean streets. There are some things that everyone tells you that are totally true and I'll reiterate some of them, but there are a lot of things that no one told me that would've been nice to know beforehand.

<h2>Counter-steering is for real</h2>

<div class="pull-quote">It’s not a myth, it’s not a theory–counter-steering is simply how you steer a motorcycle</div>

It's not a myth, it's not a theory--counter-steering is simply how you steer a motorcycle. Trust your instructor when he tells you <em>push right, lean right, go right</em>. Truth be told, you can push <em>or</em> pull on the bars to initiate counter-steering and initiate lean, so the MSF verbiage can, I think, get a little confusing. The important thing to remember is that to turn to the right, you point the front wheel to the left. To turn to the left, you point the front wheel to the right. Understanding the phsyics behind it isn't real important, but I promise that it's legit. It's easy to doubt, but take a leap of faith and you'll learn real motorcycle control.

<h2>At speed, only very small inputs are required for turning</h2>

When you're moving slowly (i.e. less than 10-20 mph), it may be necessary to turn the handlebars to full lock in order to make a turn, but that's because you're turning without leaning. When you get to speeds where you turn by leaning (initiated by counter-steering), you will not turn the handlebars much at all. Very slight inputs on the handlebars will give you all the lean you need to make turns.

<h2>A moving motorcycle wants to stay vertical--there's no danger of tipping over</h2>

When I started riding, I was apprehensive about falling over when leaning into turns. But once a motorcycle is moving forward at a decent clip, there's really no chance of it falling unless you pull something stupid. A bike in motion naturally wants to stand up and will in fact fight against you, trying to stand up while you counter-steer to tip it into turns. Think of a bike as a Weeble Wobble, and if you don't trust me then <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78lKWG8Y7q4">watch this video</a>.

<h2>If you're going to drop the bike, it'll be at <em>very</em> low speed</h2>

When you're not used to handling the weight of a bike, low-speed maneuvering--in parking lots, garages, pulling out of driveways, coming to a stop--can be sneakily dangerous. Simple dips in the road, a change of angles from a driveway to the street, can cause the bike to shift weight unexpectedly. Be prepared. And don't forget to put down the kickstand before dismounting. I forgot, three times.

<h2>Always park facing uphill</h2>

Motorcycles don't have reverse gears, so if you need to go backwards you're going to have to do it with leg power. I've made the mistake of parking with the bike's nose pointed downhill, into a curb, and it is not easy to get away from the curb. When possible, <em>always</em> park facing uphill.

<h2>Backing into a parking spot is safer than backing out</h2>

In a typical non-parallel parking spot, you're going to have to either back into a spot or back out of it. Backing out of a spot puts your back to possible traffic behind you, while backing into a spot puts your back to an empty parking spot. All other variables being equal, you're generally better off backing into a parking spot to make an easier exit into traffic.

<h2>Mind the winds</h2>

<div class="pull-quote">On a motorcycle, wind matters</div>

The first evening I rode the Ninja home in gusting winds was a bit of a shocker. I couldn't believe that no one warned me about wind beforehand, and a couple of coworkers that started riding around the same time had similar sentiments. On a motorcycle, wind matters. It'll threaten to push you around, possibly shoving you into other lanes of traffic. Generally, you can mitigate the effects of wind by keeping your arms loose, especially your elbows and grip on the bars. The wind will actually push your torso a lot more than the bike, and if your shifting torso moves your arms with it--and your arms are stiffly connected to the handlebars--you'll impart the wind force through your body sail directly into steering inputs. Keep loose, and your torso can get battered without causing accidental steering force.

<h2>Be careful with the rear brake in the rain</h2>

If you've ridden a bicycle much you've probably learned that pulling the front brake is dangerous and could flip you over the handlebars. That is not a concern on a motorcycle--the front brake must be used as your main brake, applying roughly 70% of your braking power into the front wheel. That doesn't mean you should neglect the rear brake, but be especially careful with the rear in the rain or in other low-traction conditions. Because weight transfer shifts forward under braking, the rear tire has less traction potential, and in the rain it is easy to exceed that potential and lock the rear tire. It's not catastrophic, but it's startling and could put you down if you're not careful.

<h2>The left side of the road is most visible to other drivers</h2>

Almost exclusively, I stick to the left side of the leftmost lane in city riding. From the far left side of the road, cars pulling in from the <em>right</em> of the road are more likely to see you earlier--if you're to the right, it's easy to inadvertently hide a bike behind a car parked on the curb, or behind a road sign. As well, positioning yourself on the far left will usually make you more visible to traffic in oncoming lanes, as you don't risk hiding behind other vehicles that are in the left lane. The nearest I've been to an accident happened when I was in the right lane of a six lane city avenue, and a truck in the left lane stopped to make a left turn, hiding me from the view of an oncoming SUV preparing to make a U-turn. The SUV didn't see me and whipped in front of the stopped truck, directly into my path of travel. Had that driver made a simple left turn instead of a U-turn, I am 100% certain that I would've hit her, but the full U-turn gave me the precious inches to avoid the collision. I now <em>immediately</em> get to the far left of that road when I'm on it, which is basically every weekday morning.

<h2>On the street, nobody sees you</h2>

<div class="pull-quote">If you think people see you, pretend that they don’t</div>

If you think people see you, pretend that they don't. This is a truth I learned to respect in my years of bicycle commuting in Seattle and Sacramento. People in cars are looking for other cars, not looking for bicyclists and motorcycles. If they're not looking for you, they won't see you. You can take measures to make yourself as visible as possible--clever lane positioning and your clothing can help--but you should always assume that nobody sees you, even if you think they looked right at you. Do not put your faith in other people. It's up to <em>you</em> to avoid getting hit.

I'm scratching only the surface here, and strongly suggest researching more riding literature before braving the streets on two wheels. The <a href="http://dmv.ca.gov/top_nav/top_nav_pdf_link.htm">DMV motorcycle handbook</a> is a good start. I also read the <a href="http://www.bikesmartmct.com/BRCRiderHndbk_2005v6.pdf">MSF text</a> in the eager weeks before taking the course. And David L. Hough's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Proficient-Motorcycling-Ultimate-Guide-Riding/dp/1889540536"><em>Proficient Motorcycling</em></a> is a must-read, packed with years of true wisdom and warnings. A lot of the ideas are shared in all three texts, but the redundant reiteration can only help cement the caution to your brain. Caution is good.]]></content:encoded>

This is a universal truth. Come into a corner too hot? Space will allow you to dump speed. Need to swerve left or right on a freeway? You better be in a staggered position (space). Stopped at red light? Watch your rear view mirror until the car coming up on you stops before hitting you (keep your rear space). Assume that every person in a car or truck is drunk and on a cell phone while driving. That is a distinct reality anyway.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I really enjoy reading your posts. I've been riding dirtbikes since I was 12 or so, and in 2007 I took the plunge and got my first street bike, a 1996 ZX-6R. I try to ride as often as the Midwest climate will allow, and I find myself taking half-hour detours on the way home from work just to enjoy the experience. There's something about riding that automatically turns you into a motorcycle evangelist, and I've found myself rattling off a list similar to yours to a number of friends who are new to riding.]]></wp:comment_content>

				<title>Against the wind</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Twice this morning on my ride into work, I came to familiar stops and awkwardly tilted to the <em>right</em>. That's awkward because I <em>always</em> tilt to the left, dropping my left foot to catch the weight of the bike at stops while my right foot holds the rear brake. The first error could have happened any day, but two on the same short trip to the office? Oddly, it wasn't until I reached my destination that I realized the impetus to my bobbles--it's bloody windy.

The gusting wasn't so subtle in the evening, with winds in excess of 40 mph pushing everything toward the gaping mouth of the bay. The last hour of work I anxiously listened to the howling from the lashing gusts, watching the palms outside struggle to hold their ground. It hasn't been windy like this for a while, and the outdoor armageddon had me half dreading the ride home.

<div class="pull-quote">It felt like Wild West, only in more modern leathers</div>

Wind and me (and my bike) go way back to March 2008 when I first started riding. I got about a million warnings about other drivers, a few warnings about clutch control, and even warnings to switch the petcock to "off" when dismounting (the new Ninja 250 doesn't have a petcock), but was issued exactly zero warnings about riding the bike in wind. It can be hairy if you've got the rigid death grip of an infant rider.

Fortunately, somewhere between last year and now I've lost the death grip. And that, I think, is key to fearlessly riding against the wind. Shoulders and elbows loose, the battering my head took this evening didn't translate to accidental steering inputs. The bike's fairing still caught the westerly gusts like a sail, pulling the bottom of the bike out into a half-lean that, sans 40 mph persuasion from the port side, would otherwise result in a sharp left turn.<!--more-->

But there was no fear of veering out of my lane today. In place of fear, thrill. The usually tedious freeway took on the life of a stampeding herd, deafening wind roars tossing slab-sided cages side to side, the city's daring motorcyclists assuming the role of horsemen imposing intent on the chaos. It felt like Wild West, only in more modern leathers.

Exiting the harrowing freeway, I felt both relief and a bit of disappointment, not yet wanting to end the ride, like unbuckling from a roller coaster and needing another go. If memory of last year serves me right, I've another two months of evening hurricanes. Bring it on.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Dusted by old men in Marin</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[At the moment I was unsure which oddity was more absurd, 1) me already awake and a half hour from home for a group moto ride at 8:00 AM on a Sunday morning, or 2) the lot of 50-to-60-somethings on DR-Z and GS behemoths warning me and another newcomer that, in so many words, we were about to get dusted and shouldn't ride over our heads trying to keep up. Two of the men admitted to recent knee replacements.

Now, I know the only thing absurd in that moment was my evaluation of the ride organizers based on their ages and bikes. In retrospect, it was me embarrassingly matching the reputation of my age, a drowsy, impudent 20-something, bemoaning AM activity and underestimating a bunch of <em>old men</em>.

<div class="pull-quote">Three Ninja 250s made a proud showing</div>

Group rides don't usually appeal to me because I prefer riding my own pace and the freedom to stop at my leisure for photo ops. But this ride promised to introduce me to roads I wouldn't find on my own, and the chance to dance with another 250 or two. Three Ninja 250s (including mine) made a proud showing, and though we held up the rear of the convoy it was nothing to do with the paucity of horsepowers.

Two of us were the virgins of this weekly, ten-year tradition, and the third our gracious guide who made no bones about smoking us in the twisties but patiently waited at intersections to point us straight. I got some great satisfaction watching him outride me, confirming my suspicion that after a year and 8,000 miles on my Ninja 250 the bike has yet much more potential.

The roads of northern Marin County more than merited the crack-of-dawn start to my day. The paths we carved are among the most exquisite I've run, smoothly surfaced and guiding us through an impressive range of landscapes, each more stunning than the last. The route launched with Lucas Valley Road which conveniently connects directly to US 101 and offers much more challenge than I expected of a main road. At first climbing steadily uphill on clear roads, Lucas Valley eventually dips into darkly wooded territory, the surrounding trees creeping more and more inward until only spotlight beams of sun pock the asphalt surface.

<div class="pull-quote">Blind crests fueled the fearful part of my imagination</div>

Open, hilly cattle grounds with signs warning of possible livestock obstacles followed. Blind crests fueled the fearful part of my imagination and I dreaded a dawdling cow on the other side of each rise. Normally I'd've taken more caution, but urged by the relentless pace of the group I suppressed my concerns and screamed forward. Those back roads were almost completely devoid of cars and trucks, likely part-due to the early Sunday morning but also to the scarcity of humans. Were I a more optimistic soul, I'd think those roads were laid just for us.

After that, my memory's a blur until the first destination, a quaint breakfast stop in Occidental. Still just 9:00 AM, I couldn't stomach a meal and instead consumed a few cups of coffee I later worried might leave me with uncomfortable jitters. Fortunately, per usual, I actually felt more comfortable and confident once back on the bike. I find that almost every time I take a day trip, I ride better after I've taken a break from the initial rush.

</div><!--/raw-->

Leaving Occidental behind, we charged up Coleman Valley Road, a writhing snake of pavement that climbs out of the valley's depths. The views from Coleman Valley Road are phenomenal, overlooking green-spotted foothills before presenting the humbling expanse of Pacific Ocean. The narrow path abruptly curls downhill, the tightening bends urging me to clamp hard on the brakes as I approached each turn. The final mile stretch of Coleman Valley demands serious focus, and we mercifully stopped briefly once we hit the coastal highway for a round of photos.

The old men hustled themselves back to the route <em>du jour</em>, though I stayed put for a bit to practice my methodical (read: slow) photography. A stranger sharing the vista commented to me that the rocky precipice behind my Ninja is even more beautiful when the flowers on its cap bloom. More beautiful than this? No more maybes, I'm certain I'll make this trip again.

I cruised though Bodega Bay to regroup with the other 250s who'd made a pit stop for fuel. Our shepherd warned of an upcoming corner that claimed the pride of another Marin virgin just the week before, pushing him and his blue 650R wide, wedged into a gate just off the outside shoulder. The ribbon of highway leading to that tricky turn is the newly-paved Valley Ford Franklin School Road, a sweet blend of straights and long, sweeping bends lined with empty shallow hills swathed in yellow shag. The infamous corner wasn't so bad, though it's acuteness contrasts with the surrounding stretches' more gradual demeanor.

We rejoined Highway 1 for the highlight of the route, a relaxing run along the eastern side of the Tomales Bay. Having no concept of where I was at the time, I was stunned to stumble on such a massive body of water with land on either side. It's strikingly beautiful territory.

Before long, I found myself on familiar ground as we squirmed back down Lucas Valley Road to the route's endpoint. I turned up the aggression in the corners, eager to capitalize on the vague experience I'd already had with the road and also to eek out every last bit of thrill from a day I knew was fast closing. The 250 trio rejoined the company of faster riders and I loitered a bit to absorb the shit-shooting and camaraderie of men with a shared love of motorcycling before saddling back up for the sad ride home.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I will admit to agreeing to this ride by pure accident. A blunt e-mail from a coworker, with subject "Ride?" and body "Could be fun," received a prompt positive response from me. It wasn't until we spoke in person a couple days later that I realized I'd been signed up for an organized group ride; the oddly vague e-mail was intended to link to <a href="http://www.bayarearidersforum.com/forums/showthread.php?t=287719">a Bay Area Riders Forum thread</a> describing the event I unwittingly joined.

As it happens...

Once a year, enterprising Bay Area folks organize a massive group ride that aims to introduce new riders to the region's deliciously twisty back roads. Perhaps it's conceit that I no longer regard myself as a newbie in need of hand-holding, but I'm also not above discovering new routes and making new acquaintances. Truth is, I'm a bit of a loner-recluse unless provoked and "accidentally" joining this year's Annual Newbie Ride did some good for me.

<!--raw--><div class="photo-frame">

</div><!--/raw-->

I knew some other Newbie Ride participants were meeting at the nearby Starbucks before taking off for the main ride's start point some twenty minutes south of The City, so I scheduled to tag along with the office squad. I arrived after fueling up, standing by with a few stranger-riders while waiting for the pair from work. The group already showed significant diversity, with a couple of Yamaha R1s owned by experienced bikers, two Ninja 250s rolled in by a pair of green female riders, and a few bikes somewhere between.<!--more-->

<div class="pull-quote">No pretense of Rossi-ism, no egos to defend</div>

While the group ride was billed as an introduction for new riders, it was already clear that its appeal reached further. A relaxed tour of beautiful roads, on a beautiful day with no pretense of Rossi-ism, no egos to defend--that's my kind of ride, and evidently the kind enjoyed by other mature, safety-conscious riders. By my guess, fewer than half the roughly 200 riders were genuine newbies. A vast majority of all arrived in full gear.

<div class="google-map"><iframe frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;source=s_d&amp;saddr=Edgewood+Rd&amp;daddr=Kings+Mountain+Rd+to:CA-84%2FLa+Honda+Rd+to:Pescadero+Creek+Rd+to:Cloverdale+Rd+to:Swanton+Rd+to:CA-1%2FCoast+Rd+to:37.147729,-122.175694+to:CA-35%2FSkyline+Blvd&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=FQKnOwIdouG1-A%3BFYAYOwIdzsS1-A%3BFQmfOQIdUk22-A%3BFYqROAId_lW1-A%3BFdX8NwIdjwC1-A%3BFXGyNQIdZNe2-A%3BFVCXNAIdnqy3-A%3B%3BFfCEOAIdaJG4-A&amp;mra=dpe&amp;mrcr=1&amp;mrsp=7&amp;sz=13&amp;via=1,2,3,4,5,7&amp;dirflg=h&amp;sll=37.11899,-122.143593&amp;sspn=0.073641,0.117931&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=37.11899,-122.143593&amp;spn=0.073641,0.117931&amp;output=embed"></iframe></div>

Our relatively small local troop rolled down 280 to the main route's beginning at a vista point just off the highway, though we found no other bikes there, but a ride organizer waving us on to a new meeting spot just one exit down the freeway. A minute later and we arrived at the scene, slotting our bikes at the end of a quarter-mile stretch of motorcycles neatly filed along the road's dirt shoulder. Almost as soon as we'd plodded our way to join the mass of bodies at the far end of the street, the organizers delivered a briefing and advice before sending us back to our motos to suit up and commence the event.

The day's organization impressed me in its simplicity and effectiveness. Riders were divided into small packs, each pack headed by a lead and trailed by a sweeper, both experienced and both aware of the route and schedule. My pack got a quick pep talk from our ride leader before mounting our bikes and joining the full parade for the short meander to the first set of twisties, Kings Mountain Road.

I'd never been on Kings Mountain before, though I'd heard the name. It's pretty tight, with narrow lanes and sharp uphill hairpins that woke me up to the ride's disposition. If "Annual Newbie Ride" smacks of "tedium," consider that these roads could challenge anyone, even at the speed limit pace we followed.

<div class="pull-quote">That rider on a nice Yamaha R6 went down</div>

Kings Mountain gave way to familiar territory as we blitzed down 35, past Alice's and along my favorite stretch of 84 to turn southwest down Pescadero. The considerable road dimple that <a href="http://thesundaybe.st/adventure/the-fisherman-and-the-skeleton-guard/">surprised me before</a> wasn't an issue this go-round (though I still hit it, prepared), but a downhill, left sweeper did upset one of the riders in our sub-group. Unfortunately, that rider, on a nice Yamaha R6, went down and we pulled to the side of the road some miles ahead when the ride leader noticed we were down a newbie and a sweeper.

Most of the other sub-groups cruised by, though a few stopped to piecemeal deliver the message that one of our group had a crash. Though it wasn't an accident I'd like to have myself, the rider was fortunate to walk away without any serious injuries. Like most of the riders in the hills for the event, he was wrapped in full leather gear and was able to ride his bike home following the spill.

Resuming the route, we navigated some wonderfully vacant back roads through tall grasses before joining Highway 1 for a relaxed cool-down to the lunch spot. A couple of local businesses sponsored the event, a Honda bike dealership supplying free hot dogs and sodas to the 199 (give or take) bikers that made it that far in the ride.

Before hitting the road again, our ride leader delivered another briefing for the upcoming challenges. One bit in particular, Jamison Creek Road, would throw tight, downhill hairpins at us to go with myriad potholes and low lighting. It wasn't fast riding, but it was intense nonetheless.

It hadn't stuck me that the day was closing until we met with Highway 9 and turned north. No more new roads, just a final rip up one of the Bay Area's most popular riding roads to the rendezvous at Four Corners. Our group, now down the only legitimate newbie among us, was comfortable at a quick pace, though we were caught behind some of the slower packs. Before the final few miles, our lead pulled us off the road to wait for a clearing in traffic that'd let us better enjoy the road to its fullest. And we did.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After more than a year of riding, before today I hadn't yet taken a passenger. My girlfriend and I talked about taking the bike into the city for a movie but never got around to doing practice laps in the garage to build confidence. Remember that I mentioned I have a girlfriend, it makes the next part better.

So a scooter-riding coworker had to bring his bike into the local moto shop this morning to fix a disintegrating muffler and asked me to give him a lift to work. He meant he wanted me to drive my car, but I try to avoid driving when possible so I showed up on my bike, to his great dismay.

<div class="pull-quote">We saddled the bike with 350 lbs. of man</div>

I was actually kind of eager to try out two-up riding on the little Ninja and this was a good excuse. Last night I prepared by swapping out the rear cowl for the back seat and cranked up the preload on the rear shock (those last two settings are <i>a pain</i> to get to). Despite the fully stiffened rear shock, there was a surprising amount of sag as coworker Colin plopped his pot-bellied self on the back. We each weigh roughly the same, and together we saddled the bike with around 350 lbs. of man.

Before taking off, I had Colin use one arm to hold onto me and his other to support his weight against the back of the gas tank--it's a trick I learned from one of my Seattle amigos that prevents the passenger from leaning into the rider under braking. Unfortunately I didn't tell Colin to ignore the ants in his pants when we were moving slowly. At parking lot speed, the bike feels very top heavy and for a two-up virgin such as me it makes the slow stuff a bit nervous and wobbly.

But once up to speed, I was pleased with how normal the bike feels. We didn't hit the freeway, but the bike had no problem getting us up to the 55 mph or so limited by the route I normally ride. It's slower to accelerate when burdened with as much weight, but it's better than I expected and certainly quick enough to still outpace most traffic.<!--more-->

Not that I was in a hurry. I kept it slow and left loads of room for stopping. I really can't comment on the stopping distances with the added passenger because I was purposely over-compensating for what I knew would be increased braking time and didn't get anywhere near the limit of the binders.

Back to Colin's antsy pants: Every time we got near to a dead stop, he sat up and released his hold around me. I think he felt a bit self-conscious gripping another man in the open public, but his moving around made the slow going much more difficult than it had to be. So if you plan on taking a passenger for their first two-up experience, tell them to be an adult and hold still below 10 mph. And as a final tip for the rider, tip your head forward a bit as you shift. The brief shock of the shift is enough to tug your passenger's head forward a bit and cause a light collision of helmets, but a forward nod on your part can prevent it.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Mount Hamilton&#039;s lessons</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It took a new road to remind me of old lessons. Riding the same routes every week, I get sloppy. I don't need solid form to get 'round 84 anymore, I know what's around the bend and can admit to frequently concerning myself more with lean angle and less with the stuff taught in <a href="http://www.msf-usa.org/">MSF</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Proficient-Motorcycling-Ultimate-Guide-Riding/dp/1889540536"><i>Proficient Motorcycling</i></a>. But charging headlong into foreign corners this weekend quickly jogged my memory and exposed the <i>over</i> in my confidence that's done a bit of damage to my riding skill.

Yesterday's adventure began as a group 250 ride along Mines Road south of Livermore. I haven't ventured east of the bay for riding roads before, but I didn't mind the 50 miles of damp freeway to get my bike to the starting point. Roughly half the riders showed up with little Ninjas.<!--more-->

<div class="google-map"><iframe frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;source=s_d&amp;saddr=Mines+Rd&amp;daddr=37.40371,-121.486859+to:Alum+Rock+Ave%2FCA-130&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=FYu4PgId_4C--A%3B%3BFVdvOgIdNDy9-A&amp;mra=dme&amp;mrcr=0&amp;mrsp=1&amp;sz=15&amp;via=1&amp;sll=37.399653,-121.485872&amp;sspn=0.018512,0.029397&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=37.450332,-121.632385&amp;spn=0.591769,1.462555&amp;output=embed"></iframe></div>

Mines winds through a narrow valley, running south without an intersection for about thirty miles. A lack of intersections usually means a lack of traffic, a convention that held true as we crossed paths with no more than two or three cars during the hour trek. The road is divided into two lanes at the north end but soon turns vaguely goaty as the center line gives way to one-lane blind turns occasionally surfaced in light gravel. The surface quality is pretty good but Mines holds enough tricks that I wouldn't ride it real aggressively without knowing it more intimately.

Fortunately, the group ride pace was bang-on, and though a few slower riders fell back there was no risk of getting lost in the valley. We grabbed lunch at the unassuming Junction food stop before I parted ways with the group to cross Mount Hamilton.

As much as I enjoy meeting people with a shared interest in riding, I really do prefer riding on my own. I don't get distracted by the rider in front of me, and I remember more details of the excursion. It's also easier to stop for photos when I chance on a particularly inspiring bend of asphalt, a liberty I exercised almost immediately after hitting Highway 130 on my own.

And I find it easier to focus on my riding when I'm alone. My lines were pretty pitiful as I executed the bad habits learned over months of mundane commute. I got away with it for a while. The base of the mountain is twisty but the curves are forgiving. A few bits of strewn gravel posed the most serious concern.

But approaching the peak, the sharper the turns twist, the steeper the switchbacks switch. Sudden hairpins emerge from what appear as modest bends. Want to ride fast? Stay away from Mount Hamilton. The mountain seems eager to buck off the insolent, saving its treasure for the humble. After getting caught by a couple of turns, I mentally reset. No more attempting hang-off heroics, focus on the basics.

After coming to grips with the concept of counter-steering, the first thing new riders learn from MSF is to look through turns, not at the ground in front the bike. Big head movements make big turns possible. Physically, it doesn't make real sense. My chin does not touch the handlebars, so how can it steer my bike? But in practice it's perfect, and I know this. I apply this. And in an instant my lines are looking smarter.

The reward is sweet. At the peak of Mount Hamilton is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lick_Observatory">Lick Observatory</a>, a substantial complex built to observe stars. A shame the telescopes are pointed in the wrong direction because there's stunning beauty below.

I spent quite a bit of time at the observatory. Bikes crowded the corner of the lot where my Ninja was parked and a few drivers in cages nervously, slowly filtered through the crowd. Sights like this draw all sorts. I arrived at the site just after a pair of guys on sport bikes I'd photographed earlier as they stormed the mountain with their snarling pipes. And after me rolled in a hodgepodge group, including a sharp Triumph America sullied by a set of ridiculous ape hangers. Not my taste, but even the rider admitted they weren't the best idea on these roads where dropping arms for a second to regain blood flow could mean missing a turn.

<div class="pull-quote">They weren’t arms anymore, just numb sticks loosely attached to my shoulders</div>

The descent down the west side of Mount Hamilton tested the endurance of my own forearms. Lots of short straights and quick downhill hairpins demanded hard braking and shoved my weight into the handlebars. After a few turns my arms were taxed. After thirty minutes of the business, they weren't arms anymore, just numb sticks loosely attached to my shoulders. But I couldn't be distracted by the discomfort 'cause the challenges do not relent. Every turn is a possible surprise. And by the end of it, almost every corner had a healthy patch of gravel and dirt in the center of the inside lane, carved narrow by the double tracks of cars that preceded me.

The hour or so freeway marathon home was actually pleasantly relaxing. At least until I got nearer to The City, at which point I was reminded of another bit of riding wisdom that's especially applicable to the Bay Area: dress in layers, because 80 degrees of sun in one 'burb is no guarantee that home won't be shrouded in bone-chilling fog. I won't forget it soon, I won't forget to look through turns, and I certainly won't forget the mountain.]]></content:encoded>

Some will insist you'd have to be crazy to ride a motorcycle, and even among the initiated, others may think it slightly bonkers to tour on a 250. I've been called worse.

Educated by more than 10,000 miles in the saddle of my baby Ninja, the thought of riding the 250 from San Francisco to Seattle (and back) in a week's time didn't cause me concern. I know the bike'll do the miles, back road or freeway, without complaint. My only doubt was to the endurance of my derriere.

And so with alarmingly minimal planning, I shirked office duty, passed the cat-feeding buck to my magnificent other, stuffed some bags with T-shirts, camera equipment, and the latest issue of <a href="http://www.bikemagazine.co.uk/"><em>Bike</em></a>, and texted my Seattle-area amigos to expect me in three days.

<h3>June 17, 2009</h3>

The planned route for my first day of the trip proves that I'm an idiot: nearly 400 miles north from San Francisco, mostly along the stunning but slow-going California Highway 1. Google suggested the route might take eight and a half hours of riding, which struck my pea brain as a longish day, but doable.<!--more-->

I woke up early to lube the bike chain and test fit the saddlebags I didn't have the sense to try out before embarking on a 2,000 mile-plus journey through three great American states. I'd hoped to hit the road by 9:00 AM, but didn't find myself north of the Golden Gate until after 10:00.

Didn't stop me thinking that things were perfect. Summer in San Francisco is a mix of fog, wind, and fog, but once outside the clutches of the city, Bay Area weather is consistently sublime. Cool ocean air soothes the stinging caress of unfettered sunlight, and that Wednesday morning in Marin epitomized such faultless qualities. Fleeing San Francisco left behind great clouds, both literal and mental.

Winding down the first stretch of CA-1, a small chain of cars slowed me before breaking up just as the curves got interesting. I've indulged in the glory of those turns a couple of times before, but never in conditions this flawless. Dry roads, blue skies, and a lack of mischievous gravel sneaking into the road made the descent to the ocean a bit of a religious experience. Angels were probably singing in heavenly harmonies, but I was too focused on the wiry curves to notice.

After a quick photo stop, I geared up to continue my northern trek just as a police cruiser inched in my direction. Thinking I'd prefer the cop in front of me rather than behind, I delayed a bit to let him pass before realizing that the officer was escorting a very large, very slow convoy of construction equipment that I'd just thoughtlessly let ahead of me.

The next half hour of riding didn't see speeds above 20 mph.

It was the first of many torturous road works that'd catch me like a fly in ointment, suddenly, rudely stopping me dead from my hapless buzzing about. Quite apparently, early summer is good for road construction, an inconvenient fact that'd slow me countless times on my week-long getaway.

Further north, still on CA-1, road signs for a town called Jenner became common enough to make me wonder, "Why've I never heard of it?" Upon arriving in Jenner, the question was answered. Why it appears on so many road signs is beyond me. I pumped fuel into the bike and body at a local convenient store deli. The bike thought the gas was delightful, and the pastrami sandwich sated the groan in my belly.

A man working outside the convenience store deli was eager to chat. And eager to insist that normally he works "in the wine industry," as if a bit embarrassed by his current occupation. No shame in a job, sir, it's not like you're in politics. I learned all sorts of things from the man from Jenner. Like that Jenner was "supposed to get a new post office today," which sounded odd until I looked across the street to see that their current post office is a trailer. It's scheduled to be supplanted by a nicer trailer. And I learned that I'd run into a filming crew if I was going further north. I was. And I should probably get going...

It was around this time I realized that I was behind schedule. Not that I had any idea where Jenner was in relation to my rally point in Klamath, but it was certainly too late for lunch. I bounded. Miles along CA-1 are fantastic, and it's easy to get duped into thinking it's fast. But it's not fast. Hours after departing Jenner, I landed in Fort Bragg. It was getting late, and I wasn't even close to Klamath.

Wanting to know just how <em>not even close</em>, I pulled out my phone for a quick Google Maps survey. A shame Fort Bragg is a primitive land and that I'm such a daft city slicker. There's no Google Maps in Fort Bragg without a land line telephone connection, no matter what alien techno-gadgetry is smuggled in. I pick up a couple of AAA maps from a gas station and endured torturously bad directions from a well-meaning but mentally short-changed station attendant. He told me that Tillamook, "the place that makes cheese and ice cream," was in northern Oregon. I'll be sure to use that knowledge to get me to northern California.

<div class="pull-quote">I stumbled on the most magnificent stretch of asphalt my Ninja has yet seen</div>

Desperation to reach Klamath before nightfall compelled me back on the bike. And then, some twenty miles north of Bragg, I stumbled on the most magnificent stretch of asphalt my Ninja has yet seen. Fresh, flawless pavement winds tightly and traffic-free through trees so massive sunlight breaks through in only small spotlights highlighting the lower foliage. Through those miles of perfect riding, I almost forgot how dire my schedule was.

Well that was fun. Like Mom interrupting childhood games to do homework, US-101 abruptly halted my joyful tear up the last stretch of CA-1. Back to responsibility and getting to my hostel as quickly as possible. To my utter joy in the waning hours of sunlight, 101 is much more accommodating to speed than the coastal stretches of CA-1. One hundred miles left to Eureka. Eighty miles. Seventy. I consumed miles like orange Tic-Tacs (the best ones), popping one after the other until, without realizing, half the lot were gone. Eureka, I'd made it! Pulled out the phone and Google Maps loaded. Just an hour left to Klamath, so I dashed for the redwoods.

</div><!--/raw-->

Daylight fleeting, fog enveloping, mind racing, my morale was sapped. A quick stop for a Doubleshot gave me the juice to get to Klamath, but where's the hostel? I didn't expect a brightly lit Marriott sign, but something amid the tall redwoods and ubiquitous ground cover would be nice. I stopped at a Klamath gas station to ask for directions, but in my sad state could only manage, "Where's the, uh, h-, the um..." I sputtered enough incomprehensible H-sounds that the attendant brilliantly translated my intent and pointed me to the hostel just another five miles up the highway.

Yolked with my overweight backpack, leather gear and a pair of saddlebags, I thumped to my dorm bed after 8:00 PM. I'd been on the road roughly eleven hours and wanted to sit in bed, call the future Missus, and go to sleep. But cell reception in Klamath is worse than Fort Bragg. I hoofed it across the street to the beautifully desolate beach and harnessed enough bars for a goodnight chat before crashing.]]></content:encoded>

Determined to avoid the previous day's time crunch, I awoke at 7:30 AM to the gentle pings of Super Mario Galaxy music, showered, and departed the warm hostel. After just a few minutes on the road, I remembered that the pastrami sandwich in Jenner was all I'd eaten the day before and so I stopped for breakfast in Crescent City, parked next to a new KLR loaded with camping gear and a shiny KTM Adventure perched on the adjacent sidewalk.

<h3>June 18, 2009</h3>

I was a bit apprehensive about leaving the bike's zippered saddlebags outdoors, even more so as the waitress ushered me to the back of the restaurant, away from windows through which I might observe my baby. But as I seated my spaceman-outfitted self, I caught a view of the Shift jacket in the booth next to me. Conversation with the KLR rider ensued, with a sort of effortless exchange I can't normally let loose, on the basis that we both ride motorcycles. The shared activity shouldn't mean much, but it does.<!--more-->

Kawasakis weren't our only common ground. Turns out he and his buddy (in a sad, four-wheeled truckamathing) were making a trip parallel to my own, having left the arid depression of Fresno to ride/drive the coast into Oregon. They got back on the road while I eyed my Grand Slam breakfast a bit and nursed a couple of cups of coffee, trying to eat what I could (I'm not much for breakfast) before tackling the big day ahead.

Further north, CalTrans flaggers transformed from bearded men type into pinup-hot femmes who in these distant parts must not have the job options of a city where a pretty face, male or female, will net at least a desk job. Or maybe they enjoy the sun. A short charge forward and I'd escaped over the border, out of Commiefornia and into the promised land of the free (from sales tax), Oregon.

First thing that's different: Oregon's speed limit signs have funny font. And they've got numbers lower than one might hope for. I'd averaged my usual 50-something mpg on California roads, but through Oregon I was pumping just barely over two gallons of gas per fill with 130-150 miles between stops. I guess there's a silver lining. And the scenery is rather nice.

I didn't expect the Oregon coast to differ much from California's, but even just north of the border it's unique in its colors, painted in pastels from ocean to endless sky. I rolled into a sprawling turnout to take in the view, sharing it with strangers also snatched from their travels by the impossible beauty. For the first time in nearly 500 miles on the bike, I felt far from home. San Francisco, the office, bills, forgotten responsibilities that didn't follow me here.

Early into Coos County, signs for the Bandon Dunes, decorated with ATV and dirt bike silhouettes, tempted me to consider another way to spend the day riding. But I had to be in Eugene before nightfall, or I'd never infiltrate Washington in time to help ease a friend into the crotchety years of his life (he turned thirty), so I pushed on. Stopped for coffee and a smoothie at the best-named brew house probably in the world--Brewed Awakenings--and devoured the last bit of my coastal miles before turning east on OR-38.

Quite literally just before the turnoff for OR-38, a sign for homemade beef jerky drew me off course. I may have also needed a pee. Store-bought jerky is a bit of a letdown after growing up with parents in charge of a food dehydrator, and certainly the rugged peoples of the rugged state of Oregon know how to prepare their meats.

Er, it was very good jerky. And then I took OR-38, for the first time in over twenty-four hours turning away from the coast to head inland. The highway snakes in unison with the Umpqua River, a water so still I wondered if I'd taken a wrong turn down a road that lines a lake. It's not the bendiest stretch of asphalt, but the pervasive greenery and utter feeling of isolation held my interest until finally meeting with the great freeway I'd been avoiding with my coastal route.

Seattle, Portland, Sacramento, Los Angeles and San Diego, all considerable West Coast cities and each connected to the other by the dull, life-draining roll of Interstate 5. Were I in a hurry to reach Washington from San Francisco, and in no particular want of preserving my mental faculties, I'd cruise east from the Bay Area, hit I-5 north of Tracy, and switch off my brain for some fifteen hours of the most tedious road not in Nebraska. There are flashes of scenic brilliance as I-5 skirts Mount Shasta. Not worth it. But I'd have to endure some stretch of the beast to reach my night's bed at a Eugene hostel. Like a Band-Aid, rip it off in one quick go to cinch the pain.

<div class="pull-quote">I met a man who, with a straight face, introduced himself as 'Jag'</div>

Eugene, Oregon is "eclectic" according to Wikipedia, probably so written by someone who lives there. To folks that don't inhabit Eugene, it's a bit weird and I didn't know it until I did some walking around the Whiteaker neighborhood of my hostel. Pulled out my phone to search for coffee and I didn't get Starbucks or Tully's but <a href="http://www.wanderinggoat.com/">Wandering Goat</a>, a solitary business amid low-income residential alleys and rail lines. I've grown jaded to the crazies of San Francisco, but Eugene's beatniks are harder to ignore; they make a connection, they are--gasp--friendly and I'll admit the vibe was vaguely awkward for me. Fortunately, as it turns out in many cases, weird was good, and the Wandering Goat's latte is easily the best brew I've had in years. Plus, the barista scribbled shrubbery in my foam, which I saved for the final sips.

The hostel's inhabitants proved a bit eclectic, too. I met a Brit who flew to southern California and hoofed his way to central Oregon (he wasn't done walking). I met a man who, with a straight face, introduced himself as "Jag." And in the morning, as I prepared to leave, I chatted with the rider of a Can-Am Spyder who picked his ride after a doctor told him that a bad hip would keep him off his Gold Wing. Oh Eugene, I won't forget you.]]></content:encoded>

Cool was the morning air, a relief from the previous day's stifling, off-coast heat. The wet remains of overnight rain showers, scattered over the street and seat of my bike, were less welcome, more ominous. The third day's ride would be my shortest of the trip, a 300-mile endurance run up the sleep-inducing I-5. Please don't rain.

<h3>June 19, 2009</h3>

Interstate 5 really is <em>that</em> bad, especially between towns where stretches of emptiness offer no distraction from the dull, drone-like march of traffic. But the intense boredom allowed me time to focus on some of the finer details of distance riding. I developed the <em>endurance pose</em>, which gives me the laziest sitting position possible on the Ninja: toes on both pegs, left hand on left thigh, right hand on the throttle with elbow resting on the right knee which is propped up by the right heel on the bike's heel guard. I usually stick to the leftmost third of a lane when riding, but I discovered that the center track is significantly less worn and less bumpy, especially in the right lane where armies of 25,000 pound-plus trucks tirelessly tread. The center of a lane is typically the most oil- and dirt-soiled, but on dry roads it's not an issue.

A few drops of rain filtered down to the road as I passed through Salem, but the drizzle didn't last long enough to annoy me. Through Portland and I remembered that I need to spend real time there someday--just rolling through on I-5, the structure of the city grabs my interest, like an impeccably crafted Ridge Racer stage. Grabbed lunch at a local joint (confession: it was Taco Bell) on the north end of town and then charged into Washington state.

A gorgeous state. Near-constant rains sustain the greatest conglomeration of green things in all the West Coast. I lived in Bellevue, Washington for a couple of years after high school and I'd been back as recently as a few months ago, so the landscape was no surprise, still no less impressive. I wanted sincerely to live another Seattle summer, which the rosy bits of my memory paint warm and sunny, daylight stretching into nighttime hours behind great scattered white puffs that, for just two months of the year, smile down on instead of grin at inhabitants below. I came at the right time.

But clouds conspired to deal me a Seattle fall.

Before I'd covered much ground, the sky dumped its wares. At first, a mildly oppressive drizzle with frequent breaks giving me false hope. When the road spray relented enough to allow a view of the distant road ahead, rain storm miseries five miles into my future were thick enough to spot through a soggy visor.

An hour into the state, scattered showers turned to scattered baths, erupting into a terrifying deluge. Absolute discomfort was eclipsed by fears that I might actually fall at 70 mph into the wet mess below that'd surely obscure my corpse from oncoming traffic. A layer of water deep enough to completely mask the asphalt of I-5 inspired a disturbing musing: "Do motorcycles hydroplane?" (A later YouTube search confirmed that yes, they do.)

<div class="pull-quote">Do motorcycles hydroplane?</div>

After one hundred miles of the slog, I rolled into a rest stop off the freeway and took respite with another biker. The stop was packed with car and truck drivers seeking calm between the storms, sharing wide-eyed exchanges which suggested to me that even to Washington locals, these conditions were remarkably bad. I sipped down a paper cup of lip-puckeringly bitter coffee provided by a volunteer barber shop quartet (no lie, maybe it makes sense in Washington) and continued north into Olympia.

The worst of it was over, and I soon found myself in Redmond, Washington, a city on the eastern side of Lake Washington, opposite Seattle. I'd survived three hours of the sort of <em>just-end-me-now</em> misery that comes with the time-lapse failure to summon sick over a toilet bowl. In a parking lot waiting to meet a friend, I stripped off my waterlogged gear and discovered that my leather gloves had bled and dyed my hands black. Sitting defeated on a curb, I looked at my bike and for a moment, it looked like an angel. For all my utter distress, the bike never flinched. It pulled me through and kept me safe.

I met my friend with the grateful relief I imagine a disaster victim feels for his rescuers. Until he plainly stated that the day's storm was the first rain in thirty days, as if it wasn't a bitter irony I might resent.]]></content:encoded>

My weekend in Washington coincided with the birthday of an area friend and he wanted to mark the occasion with a celebratory moto ride to Mount St. Helens. We agreed the night I got into town that we'd make the pilgrimage only if the weather forecast permitted, and I'll admit that I secretly prayed for rain. Already a thousand miles into my interstate journey, a day off the bike struck me as a very good idea. But I didn't get my way. Overcast and early in the morning, the call came in that the ride was on. On auto-pilot, my body pulled itself out of bed, geared up, and saddled the bike to meet at the rendezvous point across town.

<h3>June 20, 2009</h3>

Though weather reports claimed rain was unlikely, the varied shades of gray hiding the true sky hinted otherwise. Nevertheless, we soldiered on. How do we get there? Oh right, two hours of I-5.<!--more-->

A lifetime later, we exited the freeway, refueled, and turned east up the Spirit Lake Highway which some book allegedly rates as the second best road in all of Washington. Our hodgepodge bike trio--an R6, Buell Lightning and my Ninja 250--snaked through the tame corners, at first held slow by a bit of drizzle that glazed the road. Pushing further east, we found dryer asphalt. And much colder air.

The scenery expands approaching Spirit Lake, stretching in wide-angle like a <em>Top Gear</em> camera trick. The narrow focus of the early bits breaks out to an open valley pushed down like a great nest lined with the state's most vibrantly green trees and gated by rocky castle spires. I surveyed the spires and wondered which point might be Mount St. Helens. And then I looked over my right shoulder and wondered no more.

The great Mount St. Helens is unmistakable, those rocky spires so much less than peers. Where subordinate peaks overlook the valley from measurable heights, only the impressive base of St. Helens showed. The mountain's pinnacle thrust into the lofty cloud cover, veiled from our humble view some 4,000 feet above the sea. By comparison, the peak of California's <a href="http://thesundaybe.st/adventure/mount-hamilton-lessons/">Mount Hamilton</a> stretches only as high as our lowly viewing point, St. Helens towering another half-mile-plus skyward. I didn't expect to be awed like this. I'd've been stunned in place, were my attention not divided between the sights and navigating the epic sweeping corners approaching Spirit Lake.

The highway dead-ends at the top of the Johnston Ridge, just north of St. Helens with a bang-on view of the volcano's lava dome. On the late June day we visited, snow still accented the creases of the mountain like the veins of a straining hand. After posing for pictures and munching our quickie-stop bagged lunches, we boarded our bikes to return to civilization.

The descent delivered more drama than the ride up. Nearly 1,500 bicyclists littered the hilly highway on their annual <a href="http://www.tourdeblast.com/">Tour de Blast</a>, which would've been no problem except that the cars attempting to pass the self-punished gluttons acted as if their cages had chainsaws sticking out the sides. The drivers didn't grasp that a bike lane provides the cyclists with all the space they need, and that pulling twenty feet into oncoming traffic lanes was an unnecessary precaution. Waiting for the spatially-challenged to circumvent the endless line of bicycles added frustration to the downward spiral. And the clouds added rain.

A few fairly serious showers further spoiled the fun. Worse yet was the biting cold, which had long ago breached four layers of leather and textile defense. A gas station at the foot of the Spirit Lake Highway provided  temporary shelter, hot coffee, and 87 octane--just as it had the previous day on my rain-soaked invasion of the state--before we rejoined I-5 for another two hours of, <em>yawn</em>... Where was I?

Figures that the day I'd spend leaving Washington would be the only one without a drop of rain. I still hadn't fully recovered from the aqueous trauma of three days prior, but after passing Olympia without a drop, fears of storming evaporated. Galloping west toward US-12, the bike and I found the summer Washington day I hoped for. Dry, big sky, and sweet-smelling green. The empty road carves an endless, sweeping corridor through towering trees to places with posh names like Aberdeen and Montesano. Compared to the bustle of I-5, it was lonely out west. And for me, loneliness is a fine companion.

<h3>June 22, 2009</h3>

Though still days from home, I felt a bit of finality as I connected with US-101, turning south toward Oregon. No more poring over maps to plot a route; 101 was the last connection I had to make, as the renowned US highway flows through Washington, Oregon and into my home city of San Francisco (and beyond). Shed a tear for adventure. Now it's just me and this road.

<div class="google-map"><iframe frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;source=s_d&amp;saddr=WA-520+E&amp;daddr=46.957761,-123.603745+to:US-101+to:N+Coast+Hwy%2FUS-101&amp;geocode=FdR01wIdI9C4-A%3B%3BFYxZxwIdeC6d-A%3BFcQ1qQIdxhmb-A&amp;hl=en&amp;mra=dpe&amp;mrcr=0&amp;mrsp=1&amp;sz=11&amp;via=1,2&amp;sll=46.911344,-123.673096&amp;sspn=0.25095,0.468979&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=46.346928,-123.057861&amp;spn=4.057109,7.503662&amp;output=embed"></iframe></div>

Washington's coast is intricately carved, comprised of grayish bays and estuaries that make for a handful of scenic water crossings as 101 meanders south. Most impressive is the four-mile-long Astoria Bridge, which spans the gaping mouth of the Columbia River that separates Washington and Oregon. The bridge stretches forever and skyward, putting me and the Ninja at what felt like cloud-level overlooking the city of Astoria. I'd been riding nearly non-stop for four hours, and so stopped in Astoria for lunch and a couple of parking lot phone calls to family.

The miles along the northern coast of Oregon ticked off without drama. Though I expected my lazy roll through Tillamook would be uneventful (despite the zeal of Fort Bragg's gas station attendant), the valley town delivered the most peaceful and welcoming view of the trip. Tall mountain ridges guard Tillamook's eastern flank and contain flat pastures of green and purple hues. The overcast, blue-gray skies broke open enough to let in only streaks of direct sunlight. Forget the cheese and ice cream exports; Tillamook folks keep the best stuff to themselves.

<h3>June 23, 2009</h3>

I rose early from my hotel in Newport, Oregon to grab coffee with a work acquaintance I'd only ever met online. Left New Port behind and within an hour I was drawn off the bike by the allure of tide pools. Slipping down the sandy hills and squeezing through narrow crevices to reach the beach with my helmet and camera gear in hand proved a delicate operation.

<div class="google-map"><iframe frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;source=s_d&amp;saddr=N+Coast+Hwy%2FUS-101&amp;daddr=CA-101%2FRedwood+Hwy%2FUS-101+N&amp;geocode=FcQ1qQIdxhmb-A%3BFcfQegIdBmKa-A&amp;hl=en&amp;mra=dme&amp;mrcr=0&amp;mrsp=1&amp;sz=16&amp;sll=41.605319,-124.097078&amp;sspn=0.008584,0.014656&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=43.197167,-123.969727&amp;spn=4.284447,7.503662&amp;output=embed"></iframe></div>

I'd been to Oregon once as a kid, and my favorite memories were made browsing tide pools, examining the ocean's leftovers: star fish clinging to craggy rocks, trapped sea slugs being gross, sea anemones covered in tiny pebbles and shells, and small fish bouncing between the shrunken boundaries of their temporary cells. The beach I explored off the bike didn't hold the creature variety of my old memories (it's never as good as memories), but I didn't have much time anyway. Back to riding.

A few brief segments of US-101 south of New Port are brilliant. Phenomenal views, outstanding road quality and the first bends worthy of the "twisties" moniker since I left CA-1 days before. The great parts don't last long, so I made special efforts to guarantee I was past slow drivers in the duller straights. I may have made enemies of a few oversized RVs, and apologies to the plodding Harley group I overtook one bike at a time. Those scarce bends are too good to waste.

I eventually found myself treading familiar territory and stopped for a much-needed lunch at Brewed Awakenings in Bandon. I wanted to hit a couple of photo ops I missed on my rushed ride north, including a shot in front of an uncharacteristically friendly-looking tyrannosaurus in a gravel lot that almost embarrassed me in front of a couple of kids. Back over the California border and I giggled at the "First Chance Liquors" sign that days before read "Last Chance Liquors"--it's cleverly double-sided, but I wonder what the business license states.

The liquor sign wasn't the only change. Noticeably, my mood lost its adventurous edge. Home was within reach and part of me just wanted to be there. <i>Six more hours of riding wouldn't be so bad, right?</i> Except it would. I settled for a submarine sandwich in Klamath and another quaint stay at the hostel in the redwoods.

<h3>June 24, 2009</h3>

The final stretch. In picking my route, I planned my last day as a bit of a throwaway, a six-hour tear down US-101 which, through California, is nowhere near as scenic or otherwise enjoyable as its more northern portions. The highway peels away from the ocean for a more direct route to San Francisco, forsaking coastal breezes for hot and stuffy mountain passes.

<div class="google-map"><iframe frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;source=s_d&amp;saddr=CA-101%2FRedwood+Hwy%2FUS-101+N&amp;daddr=37.808767,-122.477217&amp;geocode=FcfQegIdBmKa-A%3B&amp;hl=en&amp;mra=dme&amp;mrcr=0&amp;mrsp=1&amp;sz=14&amp;sll=37.805783,-122.476444&amp;sspn=0.036281,0.058622&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=39.859155,-122.288818&amp;spn=4.511211,7.503662&amp;output=embed"></iframe></div>

South of Eureka and I had to ignore the turn for CA-1. It's possibly the best road in the world, but I didn't have time for it today. My overloaded backpack had taken a toll on my shoulders, and I really just wanted to be home. Just three hours to go.

The bright side to 101? Posted speed limits that occasionally felt too fast for the road if only because the guys in the twenty-year-old mega sedans looked ready to bin it around each bend. Freeway usually bores me, but that blast didn't. When a BMW GS took to tailing me for an hour, I wished for twistier stuff so I could show him what 250s are made for. But without twisties, he was stuck with the blaring drone of 9,000 rpm through a Two Brothers end can.

I finally lost the GS tail when I rolled into Willits and pulled over for a necessary cold beverage and to peel off the sweat-tinged warm bits of my gear ensemble. Fewer layers made the rest of the hot ride appreciably more bearable, or at least until I got back into The City.

San Francisco greeted me the same way it sent me off--with an embrace of fog, and winds that'd decorated the Great Highway with puddles of sand. Home sweet home. I covered nearly 2,500 miles on my bike in the last eight days. No tire tragedies, no near-misses, nothing to suggest that it wasn't among the best weeks of my life. I wondered if I'd do it again. I'd be crazy not to.

It makes for a great reading mate, and reminds me of a quite similar road trip i made from Vancouver to SF and back in the summer of 1999...but in a rent-a-car Mustang.

Your writing makes me wish for another adventure travel for this summer...

He's rolled on about 3,000 freeway and city miles since then, so I figured it's high time he be acquainted with some real roads. Last night he endured the obnoxious I-80 to reach San Francisco from the Sacramento area. This morning we rode further south, target: Santa Cruz.

I lead the way and started him easy, with a relaxing cruise down the gentle Highway 1. Sights were phenomenal, despite endless low-hanging cloud cover forming occasional fog. I do this ride almost weekly yet I'm not jaded, but Brian was even more impressed by the display of nature. Onto 84 and I wanted to see how he'd handle it. Fantastic.<!--more-->

Grabbed lunch at Alice's and did some bike watching. Crazy number of classics on display today, I want the red MV.

Highway 9 brought us further south, and aside from one stubborn and slow car that wouldn't pull over--even after enough honking that my weeny horn's voice cracked--we were unimpeded until Felton. Into Santa Cruz and it was <i>hot</i>. Parking was madhouse, thank goodness for motos. We walked the Boardwalk  but were too hot and laden to do anything. Naturally, five minutes north and the cool ocean air turned sweaty jackets into swamp coolers. Oh, that's nice. No wait, that's cold. Colder. Freezing. Poor Brian still has 100 miles of I-80 before his day is done.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Commuting to and fro the office during the week usually keeps my hunger for moto under control. But sometimes the fifteen minute jaunts aren't enough to get me to the weekend. The 1,000 mile marathon last week proved a bit of an indulgent binge that left me with aching withdrawals. So I took the long way home.

I raced against two rivals. Breathing down my neck was a fuel gauge inching closer and closer to empty. The more distant threat was the sun, also plunging down at a rate I'd have to outpace. Equipped with a tinted visor, I couldn't get caught in the dark. Still, I aimed for the town of Half Moon Bay, which lies just outside the great riding roads but is far enough to administer a getaway fix.

I tell myself I want to move into practically every distant town I visit on the bike, and Half Moon Bay is probably the most realistic of those ephemeral daydreams. So my miniature escape was also a bit of a commute test run, an inquisitive look-see to learn what traffic into Half Moon Bay might be like on a typical evening commute. Should I ever move there. Blasted down 101 to 380 and then onto 280 S. The Junipero Serra freeway was as clear and upbeat as ever, dawdling cages keeping right to let the hurried souls charge unimpeded at over 80 mph. Took the exit for 92 W and it has to be the best off-ramp ever, a mile-long stretch of scenic bends overlooking the Crystal Spring Reservoir far, far below.<!--more-->

<div class="pull-quote">Orange washed the sky, a lone cloud formation painted in purple and red ink blots pointing to the sinking sun</div>

Traffic into Half Moon was peaceful. I passed by the top of 35, closed my eyes and imagined veering left toward Alice's. But must get fuel. Rolled into a gas station and pumped in a healthy supply, suggesting I was about as low as I've been in a while.

Highway 1 was beautiful. And as I rolled back into San Francisco, the sky opened and displayed the most stunning sunset I've seen in years. Orange washed the sky, ocean and hillsides surrounding the Pacific, with a lone, massive cloud formation in the form of a Rorschach betta fish painted in purple and red ink blots pointing to the sinking sun. I was reminded that where I already live is pretty special.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[Commuting to and fro the office during the week usually keeps my hunger for moto under control. But sometimes the fifteen minute jaunts aren't enough to get me to the weekend. The 1,000 mile marathon last week proved a bit of an indulgent binge that left me with aching withdrawals. So I took the long way home.



I raced against two rivals. Breathing down my neck was a fuel gauge inching closer and closer to empty. The more distant threat was the sun, also plunging down at a rate I'd have to outpace. Equipped with a tinted visor, I couldn't get caught in the dark. Still, I aimed for the town of Half Moon Bay, which lies just outside the great riding roads but is far enough to administer a getaway fix.]]></wp:meta_value>

<a href="http://thesundaybe.st/motomalism/sur-to-malibu-part-ii/">PART II: Malibu canyons</a>

</div><!--/raw-->

I've lived in California for most of my life, but Big Sur might as well have been in Greece. In my twenty years of local residence, California's central coast remained a mystery. Is Big Sur a city? A region? A frame of mind? I intended to discover en route to a group ride arranged by my future mother-in-law in the Santa Monica mountain canyons surrounding Malibu, more than four hundred miles south of home in San Francisco.

In the days leading up to the trip, I still hadn't pinned down a route. I knew for certain only that I wanted to ride through Big Sur. On the way down or the ride home? Unsure. All the way on Highway 1 or just a quick grazing of the coast? Who knows. The route I <i>really</i> wanted would take more than ten hours, tracing Highway 1 from Santa Cruz to San Luis Obispo, and I feared a time paucity panic reminiscent of the <a href="http://thesundaybe.st/motomalism/seattle-and-back-act-i/">first day of my Seattle trip</a>. US 101 would usher me to my destination in half the time and seemed the logical option.

<h3>August 7, 2009</h3>

Logic is overrated. With all the providence of a hormone-gorged adolescent on prom night, I picked the long way.

<div class="google-map"><iframe frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;source=s_d&amp;saddr=I-280+N&amp;daddr=37.024484,-122.025146+to:CA-1%2FCabrillo+Hwy+to:US-101+N&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=FRjqPgId-zyz-A%3B%3BFVZkKgIdeC28-A%3BFWYHCQId1Njr-A&amp;mra=dpe&amp;mrcr=0&amp;mrsp=1&amp;sz=10&amp;via=1,2&amp;sll=37.142803,-121.875458&amp;sspn=0.594414,0.947571&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=37.142803,-121.875458&amp;spn=0.594414,0.947571&amp;output=embed"></iframe></div>

In an insincere display of prudence, I took inland freeway south until Santa Cruz. To bridge my path to the coast, I had to take Highway 17. The 17 is a bit nutty, which suits its destination. For a freeway, it's crazy twisty, narrow and teeth-gritting quick. And traffic isn't light. Around one sweeping right-hander at 55 mph, brake lights bulged red as cars squeezed left past a stalled big rig in the right lane. Fortunately that was the last of 17's drama. As Highway 1 came into view, the sky opened, wide and blue, sun still rubbing its eyes open in the early morning.

Between Santa Cruz and Monterey, CA-1 bears a modest and sedate line through sprawling farm lands. Countless produce stands dot the road side and advertise enticing prices for fruits and veggies that shame grocery store impostors. If only my saddlebags had room to spare. And refrigeration.

Curiously, it wasn't until Monterey that I caught my first clear view of the ocean. Just a skip further south and I was in Carmel, which from the highway doesn't impress with poshness the way its obnoxiously uppity full name suggests. Signs insist it's <i>Carmel-by-the-Sea</i>, which I hope to never hear uttered aloud. Still, I dared pull over for gas and coffee in the Highlands and fired off a couple of text messages to my treasured fiance, just to brag about my vacation while she was trapped at work.

I got back to Highway 1, still not sure what constitutes Big Sur. But just a few minutes south of the Carmel Highlands, I got a clue. In an instant, the coast transforms. Hillsides steeply plummet into the brilliantly blue sea with innumerable craggy islands too small to stand on giving the effect of a sprawling global landscape miniaturized and condensed, presented as God might see the world.

Views wax more and more epic, the sheer cliff faces appearing as barriers to Rivendell, with tastefully sculpted, arched bridges spanning rocky divides and completing the Lord of the Rings motif. The road's bends form a stage for riding heroics; weaving in and out of the hillside, cutting inland before sharply winging back toward the bony cliffs, Highway 1 through Big Sur is choice tarmac.

A shame it draws so many tourists. I don't mind sharing, but the road was often hogged by long lines of inconsiderate lallygaggers. I don't demand slow drivers pull over the moment they see me itching to get by, but bypassing a series of perfectly suitable turnouts is infuriating. "Don't make me be rude," I thought out loud in my helmet, "Don't make me act uncivilized." Another ignored turnout? Sorry clown, enjoy my high beam. I'm usually quite prudent in my passes, always waiting for legal opportunities, but double yellow painted lines lose their meaning when painfully slow <i>Tour America</i> Winnebagos stubbornly disgrace roads like that.

Hours flipped by like a Hollywood montage dubbed in Spanish (I tend to sing and think to myself in Spanish when I ride long distance). Before I'd tired of the world-in-a-bowl scenery of the Big Sur coastline--as if I could--Highway 1 dumped me onto the southern end of US 101. I spent seven hours riding to San Luis Obispo, a distance saner routes could cover in three. But there's no doubt the Big Sur excursion merited the time suck.

Another three hours of US 101 separated me from my destination, so I hustled. There's nothing unpleasant about the freeway, but without the distractions of Tolkien vistas and RV circumnavigation, time dragged. Fuel neared empty as I approached Santa Barbara, and I wanted to make a stop in the fair city to see if it's as beautiful inside as its veneer. But I rolled into town at the peak of rush hour traffic, which clogs the city of 100,000's only major asphalt artery. Instead of stopping to enjoy a minute of the stunning seaside city, I spent the next half hour splitting narrow halls between crawling cages, my eyes furiously scanning motor body language five seconds ahead.

Lane splitting is mentally exhausting after just a couple of minutes, so I was properly frazzled by the time I reached Ventura. I exited the freeway and gave the bike its last drink of gasoline before reeling in the last miles of the 101 freeway.]]></content:encoded>

US 101 would usher me to my destination in half the time and seemed the logical option.]]></wp:meta_value>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I'm very happy to have found your blog. I've read the whole thing and am anxiously awaiting more reports! I've been riding an '09 Ninja (also blue) since January '09. I've got 5,200 miles so far. My boyfriend and I are actually planning our first big trip: LA to San Rafael over Christmas/New Years. Thanks to you, we've already made plans to take 84 to Alice's on our way into town (hopefully we'll plan it well enough so we're not exhausted). And, we hope to take a day trip up north from San Rafael on the route you wrote about in "Dusted by old men in Marin."

I would love to get your opinion about what to expect in San Fran at that time of year. I'm planning on serious cold and rain. But, my boyfriend is hoping to get by with his mesh suit, wind/rain liner, and layers. What are the chances I'll have a wet, cold, grumpy boyfriend?

Also, you've done some serious long distance rides. Have you ever considered bar risers or any other mods? I've already ordered the risers, but I don't have them yet. Of course, you're <I>much</I> younger than I am! I'll be just barely 39 on our ride up there.

Another question: how long did your stock tires last? I plan on getting Battlax BT45s before the trip. But, I'm curious how many miles you got on yours.

Thanks for sharing!]]></wp:comment_content>

Weather in San Francisco's winters can be tough to predict. Some years it's endlessly raining, others (like last winter) are pretty dry and chilly. Expect temperatures between low 40s and mid 50s--layers are a necessity. Be prepared for wet, though generally you won't get much. I got through last winter in just my leather/textile hybrids, sans any waterproofing.

I haven't experimented with bar risers. I find my <a HREF="http://thesundaybe.st/motomalism/seattle-and-back-act-iii/" rel="nofollow"><I>endurance pose</I></A> gives me the comfort I need for distance riding. One bit of touring comfort advice I'd give is to avoid wearing a backpack. On my Seattle trip, my backpack was the only source of discomfort (and it was pretty bad late in the days). I ditched the bag on my ride to Southern California and had no discomfort whatsoever--just blissful motorcycling.

The '08 250s (like mine) came with different stock tires than the '09s. I swapped my rubber at around 7,000 miles--the front still had plenty of life, and even the rear was okay for longer, but I was anxious to upgrade to the Pirelli Sport Demons. With my Sport Demons, my rear lasted about the same 7,000 miles and the front is still going strong at around 9,000. I'm not sure how tread life compares on the '09 IRC stockers, but I imagine it's comparable.

Enjoy the trip! The <a HREF="http://thesundaybe.st/adventure/farewell-2008/" rel="nofollow">New Year's Eve trip</A> I made last year was one of the most memorable I've had.]]></wp:comment_content>

My real reason for being in Southern California is too embarrassing to admit (<em>baby, ahem, shower</em>) but I had the fortune of a good excuse to skip on the future-in-law family outing to Meryl Streep's latest theatrical assault on masculinity. I'd been set up on a blind moto date (purely platonic) with a group of experienced gents. They were billed as "old man sport bikers," but none of them <a href="http://thesundaybe.st/adventure/dusted-by-old-men-in-marin/">were on trick knees</a> or anything. To my knowledge.

<h3>August 8, 2009</h3>

Because we started the day early "to beat the traffic, the heat and the Harley riders," I layered a thermal under my jacket. Mornings in San Francisco are always chilly, but I quickly learned that Southern California in August is <em>always</em> hot. Before we'd even left the meeting point, the thermal layer was in my tank bag and I was still a bit sweaty-sticky under my gear. Must. Create. Air flow. Before too long--maybe a little too long--we left morning coffee behind to carve some canyons.<!--more-->

I left the path finding to the two locals, both of whom were mounting 1,000cc uber-bikes, one a Yamaha FZ1 and the other a Honda RC51. Four of my bikes wouldn't equal the horsepower of one of theirs, and so I hoped we wouldn't endure much superslab before hitting twisty bits where the 250's power deficit might shed relevance. I didn't cry a tear when we ignored the freeway on-ramp and, way before I expected, rolled to a stop at the base of Decker Canyon Road. My chaperon leaned and yelled over the bellow of his Yoshimura pipes thrumming a V-twin rhythm, "We'll take it easy," before ripping around the first bend.

Decker Canyon is steep and intensely tight, with hairpins stacked atop each other as the road climbs up, up and away from civilization and into the mountains north of Malibu. Good thing the guys leading me took it "easy" as I had to push to match their pace. Brake late and <em>hard</em>, pitching all my weight onto my wrists and into the handlebars, lean into a corner and there's no way to keep up without separating ass from seat. Weight inside, trailing the front brake, peg the apex and break open the throttle, <em>wah-wah-wah</em>, upshift for a few revs and immediately downshift, strangle the brake lever for the next lascivious bend.

After thoroughly separating ourselves from society, we veered east on Mulholland Highway. I didn't know it, but I was being escorted to a popular stretch of Mulholland locals know as The Snake and which comprises bends and road quality worthy of a racetrack, chiseled into the sloping canyon wall and marked by terrestrial sculpting more perfect than the contrived Disneyland Matterhorn.

At the base of the course is The Rock Store, a business that attracts motorcyclists of all sorts and allegedly Jay Leno and other celebrities on occasion. I couldn't say what The Rock Store's business is, because while we spent ten or fifteen minutes wandering the parking lot, I didn't bother to go inside. Outside, a display not too unlike the usual lot at Alice's offered some firsts for my eyes. A Vincent Rapide tricked me into thinking I'd spotted a mint Black Shadow. Across the lot, a cherry Indian stood apart from the Harleys, dressed in a shade of brown that went extinct decades ago.

Commonly, my escorts ride up and down The Snake three or four times on a weekend excursion. It's worth indulging. We decided to run back to the top for photos, but the RC51 had killed its battery. The two of us that didn't leave our headlamps shining while we wasted time in The Rock Store's lot took back to the road anyway and the Honda rider assured us he'd join when the bike started. We loitered at the top, where I snapped some shots and noted the delicate ecosystem of highway, motorcyclists and cops, both human species cohabiting the narrow stretch of asphalt in peaceful harmony. The police weren't on the scene as predators eager to chase riders with hungry citation quotas. To the contrary, I witnessed a CHP cruiser pull onto a narrow gravel shoulder to let a motorcyclist pass from behind. The only prey was an endless supply of tasty corners that seemed to have multiplied like rabbits. Aggressive riding's no problem on Mulholland. Just population control.

I surveyed the road, the landscape and the motos that traced the skinny lines in distant hills around me. After what must've been near a half hour, the rider with a dead battery rolled to the top of The Snake will fully juiced electrics, having signed a liability waiver to demo the Zero S electric motorcycle its manufacturer was showcasing at The Rock Store. The bike looks hot, compact and capable. Granted, the sound it makes is less stirring than a plug-in leaf blower, I figure I'll happily make the electric jump when there's infrastructure to recharge with the convenience of a petrol fill.

After tear-arsing back down to The Rock Store, a dash of smart phone Googling assured me the dead Honda could be bump-started. The bike's rider, trusting my cautious advice, rolled downhill, allowing gravity to massage speed into the wheels. Around the first corner, out of view, and still no internal combustion rumbling. Silence. Pushing the bike uphill won't be fun. More silence. And a minute later, <em>prowww-arrr-prrr-arrr-prowww</em>, the Honda willed itself to rejoin the living.

We turned to Encinal Canyon Road to guide us to Zuma Beach. Unlike earlier roads, Encinal carves longer, sweeping blind turns that allow for more speed...provided there's trust the corners don't sharpen. It's all new to me, so I backed off the throttle and prudently trusted the turns only as far as I could see 'em. The local literbikes excelled, and for the first time that day I was left behind. No worry, as Encinal is dead-simple to follow to the ocean.

Our posse picked up a fourth bike and a third old man sport biker, who also brought with him no fewer than a thousand cubic centimeters of displacement. A short tour of Malibu's beaches and the Pacific Coast Highway brought us to Kanan Road for more canyon carving.

Those canyon roads are seriously special and not only challenged but completely demolished my belief that California's Bay Area is home to the West Coast's best tarmac. Scorched hillsides and desert flora might not beat San Francisco's greens, but the turns are just phenomenal and much more tightly packed than I'm used to.

To traverse the Santa Monica Mountains of Southern California is to endure a constant barrage of angry corners, some so long and sharp they seem to form infinite loops that somehow connect to the next series of bends which alternately flirt with the canyon's ledge. On our final run, we passed by a Toyota MR2 on its own group joyride that also flirted with the canyon ledge. The ledge was not amused, and the driver was left with both front wheels dangling over the lip of the road, the back held down by the luck of a mid-mounted engine and two friends standing on the rear bumper. Don't see that in San Francisco.

I had thirty-six hours of rest off the bike before diving into another day-long ride to return home. I'd fulfilled my desire to see Big Sur on the way south, so surely I could shorten the return trip and just endure freeway, yes? Absolutely no. I took the long route home. The skies were overcast the entire day, and traffic was no lighter on a Monday than it was on the previous Friday--<em>get jobs, people</em>--but the coastal roads are unmissable. For the pleasure, a day is a fair price to pay.]]></content:encoded>

My real reason for being in Southern California is too embarrassing to admit (<i>baby, ahem, shower</i>) but I had the fortune of a good excuse to skip on the future-in-law family outing to Meryl Streep's latest theatrical assault on masculinity. I'd been set up on a blind moto date (purely platonic) with a group of experienced gents. They were billed as "old man sport bikers," but none of them <a HREF="http://thesundaybe.st/adventure/dusted-by-old-men-in-marin/">were on trick knees</a> or anything. To my knowledge.



Because we started the day early "to beat the traffic, the heat and the Harley riders," I layered a thermal under my jacket. Mornings in San Francisco are always chilly, but I quickly learned that Southern California in August is <i>always</i> hot. Before we'd even left the meeting point, the thermal layer was in my tank bag and I was still a bit sweaty-sticky under my gear. Must. Create. Air flow. Before too long--maybe a little too long--we left morning coffee behind to carve some canyons.]]></wp:meta_value>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the dubious pursuit of progress, I've abandoned a flawless summer and hunkered down for the chillier half of the year ahead. It is officially autumn, evidenced by retreating fog and dipping temperatures. There's no season that spells doom for motorcycling in the Bay Area, but certain months call for more clothing. Prepping myself for a Sunday ride this morning, I squeezed into my thermal bottoms for the first time since spring and took special care in tucking in my new, thicker thermal top. Preparation dulls the stabbing bummer of cold.

En route to Alice's, I decided to avoid Highway 35 and its frigid, shadowed halls. An unperforated layer of fog blanketed the sky, well above the mountain tops, and filtered out all colors but desaturated cobalt and gray. The natural lighting was perfect for photography, but I didn't have the sense to bring my camera. Through La Honda, I was shocked to see countless Ducatis cluttering a lot that's not a usual moto attraction and further regretted my absent Canon.

<div class="video-frame"><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/7020334?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="900" height="506" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>

I had a good run. An uninterrupted blast down north Stage flowed into a mostly open sweep of the western bits of Highway 84. Past La Honda, a series of three trucks pulled right to allow me to squeeze by in quick succession. The spirited pace floated delusions of invincibility through my feeble brain.

<div class="google-map"><iframe frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;source=s_d&amp;saddr=CA-1+S%2FCabrillo+Hwy+S&amp;daddr=37.330311,-122.388039+to:Unknown+road+to:CA-35+N%2FSkyline+Blvd&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=Fd-5OQIdzWm0-A%3B%3BFTd5OgIdsGK2-A%3BFU8iPAIdCs20-A&amp;mra=dpe&amp;mrcr=0&amp;mrsp=1&amp;sz=13&amp;via=1&amp;sll=37.343686,-122.389755&amp;sspn=0.074105,0.118275&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=37.343686,-122.389755&amp;spn=0.074105,0.118275&amp;output=embed" class="n2010_gmap"></iframe></div>

And then Harley rider coming the opposite direction flew by, yelling and flailing his left arm up and down. I couldn't hear the words he screamed, but the message was loud and clear: "Slow down!" A few turns further east, the cars in front of me came to a dead stop.

From my position I couldn't identify the hold-up, but an earlier sign warning of road work seemed to foretell the culprit. But as traffic slowly crept forward, the real reason behind the hog's erratic hand motions came into view: On the dirt shoulder to the right, an upside-down and shattered new Ducati 1198, and back-down on the opposite side of the road, a still-helmeted rider, unmoving. A half-dozen other Ducatis lined the corner, directed traffic around the wreckage, and seemed on top of the situation.

<div class="pull-quote">An upside-down and shattered new Ducati 1198</div>

My heart sank. The scene was a sobering reminder that I'm not invincible. Certainly not invincible hanging off a blue mess of metal and plastics on wheels at 50 mph through turns so long and sharp to obscure unknown dangers ahead.

The last couple of miles to Alice's were slow, pensive miles. As I backed the bike into the lot at STP, a trio of riders circled to ask if it was true that a tree was down on 84. A tree? If only. Sirens flooded the intimate valley, masking the usually happy roar of internal combustion engines. Every other minute, another emergency vehicle emerged from the woodwork to tear arse down 84, toward the scene of the crash.

</div><!--/raw-->

Alice's and STP were swarmed with Ducati refugees now blocked from their La Ducati Day destination to the west. Moto wrecks are unfortunately not uncommon, and so discourse carried on much as usual. The influx of Ducatis left plenty to ogle and lust for, but the Italians didn't have the place alone. A Russian Ural was the most obvious outcast, built like something from the '50s with a sidecar so integral to its design that the bike would've been missing indicator lights without it.

A small displacement stink wheel announced itself with a typical <i>ring a ding ding</i> and I had to know what it was. The Yamaha RD400 was tastefully modernized to an end of minimalism; petite, simply black, and utterly clean. It's exactly the sort of bike I'd want to grow old with. Unassuming, impossible not to love.

After an hour of coffee sipping and relaxed delay, I decided it was time to leave. With westbound 84 clogged up, I had no choice but to ride Highway 35 out of the mountains. It was cold and very damp, the overhanging trees dripping their gathered dews over the asphalt. Earlier events still fresh in my mind, I wasn't in a hurry anyway.

When I got home, I logged online to learn more about the crash. It was worse than I thought. The downed Ducati I spotted on the shoulder was just one of two motorcycles involved in a head-on collision mid-corner, resulting in both riders suffering serious injury. According to reports, the Ducati rider was not an innocent part of the crash equation. I take some solace in knowing that the crash was the result of someone's poor choice, rather than freak, unavoidable accident, but the solace is of no use to the Norton rider who was struck. I hope the best for both of them.]]></content:encoded>

I had a good run. An uninterrupted blast down north Stage flowed into a mostly open sweep of the western bits of Highway 84. Past La Honda, a series of three trucks pulled right to allow me to squeeze by in quick succession. The spirited pace floated delusions of invincibility through my feeble brain.]]></wp:meta_value>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[For many riders, a Ninja 250 is the bottom rung of a sport bike ladder, a necessary first step in pursuit of high horsepower race replicas. I can't begin to recount the myriad times I've been asked about <a href="http://thesundaybe.st/miscellany/the-training-wheels-stigma/">getting a bigger bike</a>, generally with the suggestion, express or implied, that I'm ready for a 600cc super sport. With over 17,000 miles behind the bars of my mighty 250, I've no apprehensions about <i>moving up</i>. But I'd rather branch out.

This weekend, I picked up a 1992 Suzuki DR350S, an eighteen-year-old dual sport that's seen just two owners before me and fewer than 5,000 miles. For a bike of legal age, it's in incredibly good nick, right down to the wildy '90s, pink and purple, screamin' decals. With a dual sport in my stable, new, unpaved roads are opened to me. Though before I dabble in dirt, I wanted to get personal with the DR by taking it on some of my favorite (asphalt) roads.

<div class="pull-quote">Wildy '90s, pink and purple, screamin' decals</div>

On the morning after buying the bike, I rode down Skyline to Alice's. A bike with this much retro character demands attention, and it got a few looks from other riders making the obligatory stop in the mountains. A couple guys were stunned by the low price I paid for the bike, and also surprised when I extended the kick start lever to fire it up and take off. "I'm new to this," I warned, preparing onlookers for the inevitable series of failed kicks. "Hell everyone's new to it, they don't make 'em anymore!" responded the rider of a newer GSX650F.

After Alice's, I headed for Stage Road, the beautiful but bumpy road <a href="http://thesundaybe.st/adventure/farewell-2008/">I first explored last December</a>. It's a fantastic bit of tarmac, tight and twisty, but it's not a smooth surface. On my Ninja, riding Stage requires a lot of standing on pegs to let my legs absorb the jolts my butt prefers not. It's exactly the sort of road that made me want a dual sport or supermoto in the first place, so I was anxious to see how the DR might change the experience.

</div><!--/raw-->

My ride on the DR wasn't as fast as previous tears on the 250, largely due to inexperience on the bike as well as comparatively stiff, wooden brakes. But what the DR lacks in quick responses, it makes up with compliant suspension that dulls the ripples of Stage's pavement for a significantly more comfortable ride. Reaching the end of Stage on the Ninja feels like an accomplishment, but the DR wanted more.

More will have to wait. The Suzook is an exciting addition to my motorcycling options, but a couple days on the bike gave me a new appreciation for the Ninja 250. The quality of the DR's build is unimpeachable, but the Ninja is such a polished, practical package in comparison. The kick start on the DR is novel, but after a couple dozen starts in 24 hours my right leg kills. At speed, my Kawasaki is immeasurably more solid and confident. Every control, from turn signals to steering, is lighter, more effortless on the Ninja. And the two-gallon tank on the dual sport reminds me--every 60-80 miles--that the Ninja's 150-mile-plus tank range makes the bike infinitely usable.

But it won't be long before I start really appreciating the DR's strengths. I just need to find some good dirt trails...]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[That bike is in fantastic shape. Might wanna run a can of Seafoam through the fuel system to clean out any varnish that's built up in the carbs--5k miles in 18 years isn't a whole lot of running time. Might even want to replace all the fuel lines too.

I didn't know those early DRs were kickstart only. Kickstart is nice when you're out in the middle of nowhere! Fewer things to worry about, like battery charge.

Slap a bigger tank on that beast and you'll be set!]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Is December here to strangle joy from life already? I'd rather not know.

In October, I started wrangling together a group of coworkers for Sunday morning rides every week. We've had some fantastic days, but I get the feeling that, at least until after football season, it's going to be harder and harder to motivate the pack to wake up at dawn for a casual back road tear to breakfast and coffee.

<div class="pull-quote">It's not raining, it's not that cold, why wouldn't I ride?</div>

One rider has already passed on multiple invites on account of the early hours and squeezing cold, but I wrote him off as a whiner. When this week's group completely dissolved into <I>got other plans</I>, I resigned to a solo day in the mountains. It's not raining, it's not that cold, why wouldn't I ride? It's not like it's...

...Except it <em>is</em> December.

Roaring down the 280 freeway just before noon today, I didn't consider the season. Pulling onto empty side roads, I didn't connect the absence of outdoor recreators with the chilling air. And when I crossed paths with a pack of twenty sport bikes exiting the hills as I entered, I didn't know they were running from rain.

<!--raw--><div class="photo-frame">

<a href="http://thesundaybe.st/media/denial_01.jpg"><img src="http://thesundaybe.st/media/denial_01.jpg"></a>

</div><!--/raw-->

But the damp, empty lots at Alice's and STP cracked my dense denial. A week ago, the popular moto stop was hopping with life. In the nearly two years I've been pilgrimaging to Alice's, I've never been the only bike around before today. I grabbed a coffee to warm my hands and copped a seat on the curb, waiting for the motorcycle symphony to fill the valley with spine-tingling combustion noises.<!--more-->

<div class="pull-quote">Denial crushed. Go home, summer is over</div>

The orchestra never materialized, so I turned home. Deliberating inside my helmet on the relaxed cruise up Highway 1, I entertained the possibility that the season for carefree, recreational riding has passed. Not that it'll stop me, just weaken my insistence that friends come with. I'll eagerly ride <I>just for fun</I> year-round, so long as it doesn't rain.

It started raining. Denial crushed. Go home, summer is over.]]></content:encoded>

In October, I started wrangling together a group of coworkers for Sunday morning rides every week. We've had some fantastic days, but I get the feeling that, at least until after football season, it's going to be harder and harder to motivate the pack to wake up at dawn for a casual back road tear to breakfast and coffee.



One rider has already passed on multiple invites on account of the early hours and squeezing cold, but I wrote him off as a whiner. When this week's group completely dissolved into <I>got other plans</I>, I resigned to a solo day in the mountains. It's not raining, it's not that cold, why wouldn't I ride? It's not like it's...



...Except it <I>is</I> December.]]></wp:meta_value>

I've a bit of a love-hate relationship with sleep; I love to stay in bed, but I hate that sleep is such a waste of time.

I'm not old yet, so I have to try hard to make use of the morning. In recent months, a weekend breakfast ride with coworkers has motivated me out of bed. The ride's MO in a nutshell: Meet up at an undisclosed spot by 8:00 AM, ride awesome roads to breakfast, warm up with coffee, get home by noon. Before this recent initiative, I never even started my joyrides until noon, a fact that underscores my new ambition.

The season's weather has lately slowed my early bird metamorphosis, but with an optimistic weather forecast for this weekend, I'm aiming to resume progress. Perhaps I can innervate my limp, sleepy mind with photos from our past rides.

				<title>The (im)perfect motorcycle backpack</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As a daily rider-commuter and wannabe Lewis-and-Clark, it's rare that I hop aboard the mighty 250 with less than a backpack strapped to my vessel. A ten-year-old Jansport served me well enough through my first year of motorcycling, but my <a href="http://thesundaybe.st/motomalism/seattle-and-back-act-i/">Seattle adventure</a> underscored serious weaknesses in my choice of bag. I needed a new backpack, more suitable for motorcycle touring.

The high school issue Jansport was guilty of two major sins: It offered almost no protection against rain, and, worse, it tortured my shoulders on long rides when heavily loaded. For its replacement to satisfy me, it'd need to...

<ul>
<li>...support itself with more than shoulder straps</li>
<li>...offer some sort of water resistance</li>
<li>...sport a generous carrying capacity</li>
</ul>

I looked at a lot of bags, including <a href="http://www.thewaterproofstore.com/ob1014blk.html">this Overboard Waterproof Backpack</a>. The bag satisfies all of my requirements, but I wasn't willing to take a chance on a backpack I couldn't first handle in a store. I was also aware of <a href="http://ogio.com/product.php?product=691">Ogio's No Drag Backpack</a> but doubted the carrying capacity and usability of such an odd, rigid shape. It struck me as gimmicky.

<!--raw--><div class="photo-frame">

<a href="http://thesundaybe.st/media/nodrag_03.jpg"><img src="http://thesundaybe.st/media/nodrag_03.jpg"></a>
<a href="http://thesundaybe.st/media/nodrag_04.jpg"><img src="http://thesundaybe.st/media/nodrag_04.jpg"></a>
<a href="http://thesundaybe.st/media/nodrag_06.jpg"><img src="http://thesundaybe.st/media/nodrag_06.jpg"></a>

</div><!--/raw-->

When I first spotted the No Drag in a Washington moto shop, I was surprised and impressed by the expanse of its interior. I liked the rubberized outer shell and the lack of exposed zippers. The bag's only openings are on the side that faces the rider's back, which keeps the most porous bits of the bag (the zippers) away from rain and thieving hands. Perhaps best of all, the No Drag hangs on with both a sternum strap and waist strap in addition to typical shoulder gear.

With 1,000 miles yet between home and me and my overweight backpack, the No Drag was a dream. "It will be mine. Oh yes, it will be mine." After completing the Seattle trip, I promptly ordered the Ogio from <a href="http://www.newenoughhp.com/luggage/backpacks/ogio/moto_no_drag_pack.html">New Enough</a>.

I've since used the No Drag for more than 5,000 miles and determined that it is the ideal bag for motorcycling...probably. It's not perfect. The sternum and waist straps that add support to the bag and relieve shoulder pressure also add complexity to putting the bag on and taking it off. Riding--or even walking--with the waist strap disconnected leaves dangling buckles that slap into surrounding objects. On the bike, there's no real issue with buckling in, but when I'm off and walking between shops, the extra strapping can make a chore of getting in and out of the bag for my wallet and storing things like delicious deli sandwiches.

The protected zippers and openings don't help shopping matters as it's almost impossible to get into the bag without setting it down. A typical backpack can easily swing around the shoulder and offer over-the-belly access to its contents, but the same shoulder swing with the No Drag keeps the zippers hidden between the bag and my chest. For this reason, I've had to stop storing my wallet in the backpack.

And while the bag consumes a solid 21 liters of shoes and camera equipment, utilizing all of the space isn't always possible with the sloping shape of the bag. As well, it's a tall bag, tapered top to tapered bottom. This makes it good for stashing a dozen long stem roses (tested, approved) but also necessitates some fitting to keep it from rubbing against the back of my helmet without then butting into the tail of the bike. I got it sorted for my 5' 10" body, but riders with shorter torsos may have issues.

And so the Ogio No Drag is an imperfect backpack, but is also the best option for motorcycling that I've found. The very features that benefit the riding experience inconvenience the rider away from the bike, but for me they're worth the trouble. If I could change it, I'd widen the sternum strap, giving it a pocket large enough to hold a wallet and bridge toll money, and I'd give the bag an option for storing the waist strap, as the support (and hassle) isn't necessary for twenty-minute commutes and errands.

<a href="http://thesundaybe.st/media/nodrag_05.jpg"><img src="http://thesundaybe.st/media/nodrag_05.jpg"></a>

</div><!--/raw-->

Despite some incidental shortcomings, the bag has fully satisfied my three original criteria. It's comfortable all day, it hasn't yet been breached by rain and it carries my laptop, shoes, nighttime visor and more. I wouldn't trade it for another bag. Unless Ogio uses my suggestions to improve the next model.]]></content:encoded>

I use a <a HREF="http://www.firstgear-usa.com/fgweb3.nsf/Products/1DC8801126F3782C862571F400504622?opendocument" rel="nofollow">FirstGear Silverstone Tank Bag II</A> when I prefer a tank bag to a backpack. Like the Icon you mentioned, it's got shoulder straps for wearing like a backpack off the bike, though I've not used them yet. Having a pure backpack versus a tank bag has its advantages, mostly allowing access to the gas tank and being able to take it on/off more easily than positioning magnets. But the tank bag is nice when I want to be able to ride aggressively, moving around the bike without the burden of something on my back. Ultimately, what pushes me to the backpack more often than the tank bag is the need to transport my laptop to and from work. Couldn't fit a laptop in my FirstGear tank bag. Would one fit in your Icon?]]></wp:comment_content>

I just got one for my 250--it's a tank bag so you don't have to worry about the weight of it, etc. while you're riding, but it also turns into a backpack so you can carry it around when you get to your destination. I found it to be the ideal solution. (Except that it's not waterproof--merely water resistant--but a dry bag inside can solve that just fine.)]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There's a light at the end of the tunnel of winter. It's presently obscured by fog, but it's a light alright. Days are stretching longer, and December's army of clouds is retreating.

My office's last three-day weekend was rained out, completely. Three free days, ruined by a soggy sky. I filed my complaint to no one, but someone must have listened. We got another long weekend for Presidents Day, this time without the wet stuff. With an entire Monday to waste, a couple coworkers and I boarded our sport bikes and headed north for the phenomenal roads and sights of Marin and Sonoma counties.

Tracing a route nearly identical to what I ran with <a href="http://thesundaybe.st/adventure/dusted-by-old-men-in-marin/">the old men in Marin</a>, I had to constantly reference hand-scrawled directions, paper stretched over my Ninja's gas tank, to anticipate turns onto the next valley roads. Lucas Valley Road, Nicassio Valley Road, Hicks Valley, Chileno Valley, and finally Coleman Valley Road, each offering unique challenges--damp corners, goaty asphalt, cattle grates, blind crests, and/or powdery fog--and endlessly stunning scenery, a surplus of green draped over rolling hills where cows moo.

After brunchfast in Occidental, we punched through a wall of sagging cloud to reach the coast. Parked up the bikes for a bit and threw stones at much bigger stones in the sea while shooting the shit, talking about other favorite getaways and how we might be able to shoehorn motorcycles into them.

It'd been a while since I last binged on CA-1, so I opted to guide the pack straight down the coast to return to San Francisco, rather than cutting inland for less-traveled roads. The coastal line brought the awesome sights I remembered from last year, but also the tediously slow traffic lines that plague Highway 1 during summer months. <I>But it's February</I>, I objected inside my helmet. Try as my frustration might to overwhelm me, nothing could spoil the day.

I returned home more than seven hours after I'd left in the morning, after a ride nearly as long as the work day George Washington helped me skip. Here's to our Presidents past.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Thumper's home. After waiting two months while the bike sat sadly in a local shop garage, I got the call early on Saturday morning to pick up my 1992 Suzuki DR350S. The sky threatened to open up, so I didn't plan to do anything more than ride the DR back to my apartment. But the fiancee suggested I do more, and I obliged. Late in the afternoon and short on time to plan, I kept it simple, to Alice's and back.

Fedor Emelianenko couldn't have knocked the grin off my face. Two months away from a bike is enough to make it feel freshly foreign again. My awkwardness on the stilted dual sport motorcycle, the still-messy roads from the previous day's storm, and the mechanic's advice to take it easy on the practically-new motor limited the ride to a sane pace. An utter joy, but not quite fully satisfying.

A dual sport motorcycle demands more than damp highways, so this morning I went out again, intent to reacquaint myself with the roads I couldn't fully enjoy on the Ninja. First up, Tunitas Creek Road.

<div class="pull-quote">A wild blast of rapid gear changes, blind corners, and fistfuls of throttle</div>

I'd only ridden Tunitas Creek once before--aboard the mighty 250--and remembered it for its darkly-covered, one-lane-narrow and lumpy asphalt. Not the best of conditions for budget sport bike suspension and weighted wrists, but just the sort of stuff that inspired me to buy the DR late last year. Attacking Tunitas with miles of fork travel and sit-up-and-beg posture was nothing short of a revelation. The event transformed Tunitas Creek from quirky novelty to one of my absolute favorite stretches of road, a wild blast of rapid gear changes, sharp bends, blind corners, waving bicyclists, and fistfuls of throttle.

<!--raw--><div class="photo-frame">

<a href="http://thesundaybe.st/media/dualsportsman_01.jpg"><img src="http://thesundaybe.st/media/dualsportsman_01.jpg"></a>

</div><!--/raw-->

I got carried away reveling in my dual sport's strengths and for a second forgot its biggest weakness. Compared with the Ninja 250, the DR has crap for brakes. When Tunitas abruptly dumped me onto Skyline, I squeezed hard, locked the rear over a thin layer of mud, fish tailed and gave a crowd of bicyclists something to giggle at. But hey, no foot down!

After an obligatory lunch stop at Alice's and an hour spent ogling the turnout's motorcycle herd, I made for Alpine Road to the south. Alpine is less goaty than Tunitas Creek, but it's still a place where the DR shines. Despite a painted divider line, Alpine is too narrow for two cars side-by-side. It's surface is smooth in comparison to Tunitas's whoops, but it's a coarse pavement that falls across steep, tight hills. It's enough to keep away most all automobiles, which is likely why the secluded area sees so much bicycle traffic.

</div><!--/raw-->

Semi-goat trails are great, but it wouldn't be a real dual sport outing without a bit of dirt. On the advice of one of this blog's readers, I charged toward Reservoir Road in Pescadero. It's a legit road on the map, with road signs and mailing addresses, but it's unpaved. And after last week's torrential storm, Reservoir Road is vaguely muddy. My first jaunt over a dirt path on the DR was uneventful, but satisfying. I wanted to dip into the throttle, throw a roost and stick my leg out while powering through turns, but I wasn't prepared to be muddy or fall off the bike and both would've surely happened. The pleasure of Reservoir lasted all of five minutes, but at least I can say I've taken the bike off road. Sort of. I've got spattered boots to prove it.

A visit to Pescadero would be wasted without a taste of Stage Road. And like everything I'd done today, Stage is best savored with the Suzuki DR. Beautiful as always (though <a href="http://thesundaybe.st/media/fisherton_guard.jpg">the skeleton</a> is gone), and the perfect end to a dual sport loop I'll no doubt repeat in the future.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Two years ago, M1 endorsement freshly printed on my license, a simple ten-mile morning commute gave me the thrill of a lifetime. Within months, I was making occasional trips into the mountains for the same sense of adventure. When runs to Alice's grew routine, I joined various group rides to broaden my horizons. And last summer, my drive to find joy on two wheels escalated to a 2,000-plus mile, week-long journey through the Pacific Northwest.

Another interstate conquest will have to wait until later this year, but in the meantime I've got to maintain my love affair with motorcycles--not that it's difficult. In recent weeks, I've found fascination in a game of <a href="http://www.bayarearidersforum.com/forums/showthread.php?t=325369">Bay Area photo tagging</a>. The premise: One guy takes a photo of his bike in front of a notable landmark or otherwise memorable spot and challenges other motorcyclists to match the photograph with their own bikes. The "winner," as it were, then gets to pick the next photo tag location, urging the game's players to scan their brains for memories or use Google Maps to piece together clues that lead to newly-discovered locales, some more inspiring than others.

I watched carefully as the game unfolded for the first couple of weeks, unable to identify any of the target locations. Clearly, I've a lot more adventuring to do. But eventually, one player got lazy and set the next location at a yogurt shop, with enough information in his photograph for me to Google its whereabouts. I figured it out around midnight, and as the target was a mere two miles from my apartment I geared up and rode the DR out to snap the winning picture.

I wasn't about to set up another easy shot for the game. The next morning, I took a friend out to Mines Road in Livermore, and while we enjoyed pulled-pork sandwiches at The Junction I spotted the next photo tag: a welcoming metal sculpture-thing inconspicuously laid up against the outside wall of the restaurant. I lined up the photograph, snapped it, and later uploaded the shot to puzzle other riders.

</div><!--/raw-->

It didn't take long for other players to identify the location, and one dedicated rider traversed Mount Hamilton at night--by no means a casual endeavor--to match the photo.

<div class="pull-quote">Curled up the narrow mountain road that leads to the breath-taking view of the North Bay</div>

A later challenge photograph pictured a bike somewhere high, overlooking the bay and San Francisco's downtown buildings. I didn't recognize the location, but started scouring Google Maps to figure it out anyway. With a view of the northern face of the city, the western side of the Bay Bridge and some lower hills, the photograph must have been taken from northwest of San Francisco, across the Golden Gate, somewhere in Marin. I checked the roads of Sausalito, guessing maybe the photo tag was on a hill overlooking Angel Island for the view of the city. Nothing Google gave me matched. I looked further northwest, using Google's topographic maps to find the highest location in the area, and by chance spotted a viewing point at the top of Mount Tamalpais. Gotta be it.

With a four-day business trip to New York in my near future, I had to match the Mount Tam photo quick. No time for the weekend, an after-work evening would have to do. And so as fast as I could after leaving the office, I grabbed my camera and headed north across the bridge, snaked onto the better-than-remembered Panoramic Highway, and curled up the narrow mountain road that leads to the breath-taking view of the North Bay.

<a href="http://thesundaybe.st/media/phototag_13.jpg"><img src="http://thesundaybe.st/media/phototag_13.jpg"></a>

</div><!--/raw-->

I got the shot, just minutes before the sun set (I took a second photo another mile up the mountain with much less light just moments later), which meant I enjoyed the descent back into San Francisco in darkness. I had to take the next photo tag picture on the way home, since I was flying out in the morning, and so got a bit lazy myself. But with a lack of light, a dying camera battery and no tripod, the lazy shot ended up an interesting challenge. Not that it took the tenacious Bay Area photo tag players long to figure it out.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Sometime last summer, I stopped riding motorcycles as a hobby and adopted it as a lifestyle. It wasn't a conscious effort and I'd be lying if I pointed to an exact moment of metamorphosis, but I think the end of the <a href="http://thesundaybe.st/motomalism/seattle-and-back-act-i/">first leg of my trip through the Pacific Northwest</A> was the start of it. More than ten hours on my Ninja 250 and a frantic search for a bed had triggered a bit of an internal panic that nearly broke me, but somewhere between the Oregon border and Mount St. Helens I saw my bike's saddle as more than a chair. I grew to love it like home.

The emotional comfort of lounging on the couch with my fiancée and our cat, but at 60 mph along the Olympic Highway through the kinds of greens and blues television can't produce. God I miss it. I'm going back.

I knew last year as soon as I'd returned to San Francisco that I needed to make the trip again, been thinking of another week on two wheels even since. But I'm not looking for a carbon-copy repeat in a vain attempt to relive a past experience. This year's plan calls for a different route through Oregon and, more notably, the company of a childhood friend.

The same friend <a href="http://thesundaybe.st/adventure/sunday-cruz/">I escorted to Santa Cruz last July</A> is on board with my second venture north. Four days through California and Oregon to Seattle, one day of rest and another three days back down the coast to San Francisco; that's the plan, for now. I've done a fair bit of daydream drooling over Google Maps in anticipation for the trip, and come up with this preliminary set of routes.

<h3>Day 1 | Cameron Park to Mount Shasta</h3>

<div class="google-map"><iframe frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;source=s_d&amp;saddr=US-50+E&amp;daddr=Salmon+Falls+Rd+to:CA-49+N%2FColoma+Rd+to:CA-49+N+to:CA-49+N+to:40.235509,-121.456604+to:CA-89+S&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=FfLcTQIdNOvJ-A%3BFYA9TwIdVMfI-A%3BFd4PUQIdDGTJ-A%3BFZSHVQIdVMfI-A%3BFZmhWQIdeI7I-A%3B%3BFRp9dQId2Ei5-A&amp;mra=dpe&amp;mrcr=0&amp;mrsp=5&amp;sz=9&amp;via=1,2,3,4,5&amp;sll=40.010787,-121.25061&amp;sspn=1.245366,2.469177&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=40.111689,-122.442627&amp;spn=4.973668,9.876709&amp;output=embed" class="n2010_gmap"></iframe></div>

I've agreed to kick off the trip from Brian's home just east of Sacramento. The benefit of this starting point is an easy shot to Highway 49, which was a bad word when I was growing up and windy back roads meant car-sick kids, but as a motorcycling adult now looks like joyous tarmac. The downside is a whole lot of heat. Hopefully things will cool down by the time we find a camp site near the base of Mount Shasta.

<h3>Day 2 | Mount Shasta to Crater Lake</h3>

<div class="google-map"><iframe frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;source=s_d&amp;saddr=CA-89+S&amp;daddr=41.876719,-120.493927+to:Rim+Dr+to:N+Entrance+Rd&amp;geocode=FRp9dQId2Ei5-A%3B%3BFUkRjwIdetC3-A%3BFc69jwIdtBi4-A&amp;hl=en&amp;mra=dme&amp;mrcr=0&amp;mrsp=1&amp;sz=10&amp;via=1,2&amp;sll=41.697526,-120.592804&amp;sspn=0.585493,1.234589&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=41.849105,-120.855103&amp;spn=2.319992,4.938354&amp;output=embed" class="n2010_gmap"></iframe></div>

From Shasta, Highway 97 could take us to Crater Lake with hours of daylight to spare, but when I originally routed that way the map looked a bit depressing and in need of more adventure. Enter northeast California and Goose Lake. Probably also hot. I've wanted to visit Crater Lake since before last year's trip and am elated to have worked it into the schedule this go-round.

<h3>Day 3 | Crater Lake to Mount Hood</h3>

<div class="google-map"><iframe frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;source=s_d&amp;saddr=Rim+Dr&amp;daddr=44.028371,-121.764221+to:US-26+W%2FNW+Warm+Springs+Hwy&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=FSKcjwIdZB24-A%3B%3BFQLusgIdqsu--A&amp;mra=dpe&amp;mrcr=0&amp;mrsp=1&amp;sz=10&amp;via=1&amp;sll=43.862258,-121.758728&amp;sspn=0.586171,1.234589&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=44.241264,-121.964722&amp;spn=2.345459,4.938354&amp;output=embed" class="n2010_gmap"></iframe></div>

This is the least-purposeful leg of the trip; having no other Oregon target in mind, I aimed only for a fun route that would set us up to circle Mount Ranier on the final stretch. Mount Hood came recommended by folks more familiar with the area, and the Columbus River Gorge promises stunning scenery.

<h3>Day 4 | Mount Hood to Seattle</h3>

<div class="google-map"><iframe frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;source=s_d&amp;saddr=45.278752,-121.714783&amp;daddr=2515+Rd+to:WA-410+W%2FMather+Memorial+Pkwy+to:seattle,+wa&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=%3BFehqwwIdvNu6-A%3BFQe-zAIdo4fB-A%3BFcJp1gIdWVy1-ClVM-iTLBCQVDGa1URpRmUlEA&amp;mra=dme&amp;mrcr=0&amp;mrsp=0&amp;sz=9&amp;via=1,2&amp;sll=45.392664,-121.610413&amp;sspn=1.141833,2.469177&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=46.324172,-122.387695&amp;spn=2.245739,4.938354&amp;output=embed" class="n2010_gmap"></iframe></div>

I almost missed this route opportunity because Google Maps doesn't render Highway 410 unless zoomed in pretty close. The Washington state byway traces the eastern base of Mount Rainier. On a clear day in Seattle (rare), Mount Rainer dominates the skyline from the southeast. It's properly, stunningly massive, looming with the flattening imminence of a full moon low on the horizon. I won't need clear skies to spot the mountain from WA-410, but I'm still hoping for them.

It's a fairly ambitious itinerary, but I've got faith that Brian can hang. And I hope he finds the comfort and love of home on the open road. It's a liberating state of mind.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Time to think. There's a lot of it between San Francisco and Los Angeles laid atop a 400-plus-mile stretch of US 101. It was early and I was tired, and somewhere around Gilroy the mixture resulted in a pointless but amusing thought: by the end of my trip, the mighty Ninja's little motor will have combusted and twisted some seven million times. No beat skipped.

<div class="pull-quote">Let this be the final word: Freeway is no concern for the 250</div>

I had a week of industry trade show in Los Angeles, but rather than board a plane with my coworkers and be south in an hour I seized the chance to ride a motorcycle for a day there, a day back. Work is impatient and left little time for the run down to L.A. so I swallowed the miles in one big gulp. The freeway capability of the Ninja 250 is frequently doubted, but I know better. Let this be the final word: Freeway is no concern for the 250, not even at 75 mph with drag-inducing side bags. I, however, am not quite as unbreakable.

<h3>June 13, 2010</h3>

A day of motorcycling starts with boundless optimism. Hurtling into the garlicky, warm breath of the Santa Clara Valley, I was still on fresh knees and a high of hope. "Eight hours, just me and my bike--nowhere I'd rather be." But my enthusiasm eventually succumbed to the draining batter of air breaking over the wind screen and a grease-bomb fast food lunch in Pismo Beach didn't help.

<div class="google-map"><iframe frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=FVJmQAIdKAe0-CkhAGkAbZqFgDH_rXbwZxNQSg%3BFYdnHQIdBtzO-Ckx5nYJ1OnsgDFUgT6aTt09cw%3BFYqYBwIdm77z-CkT2ifcXcfCgDH0CEYlb98v4g&amp;q=san+francisco,+ca+to+los+angeles,+ca&amp;sll=35.141248,-120.430756&amp;sspn=0.664808,1.234589&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;saddr=san+francisco,+ca&amp;daddr=35.4814796,-120.6609868+to:los+angeles,+ca&amp;via=1&amp;ll=35.93995,-120.331505&amp;spn=3.77518,4.17589&amp;output=embed" class="n2010_gmap"></iframe></div>

A thick summer fog turned my armored jacket into a swamp cooler and my attention was cat napping with disturbing regularity. A familiar roadside rest stop gave me precious downtime to relax my mind and rededicate my concentration; just a couple of minutes can have an amazing effect.

<div class="pull-quote">Half-helmeted Harley types politely pulled aside to wave me on</div>

I lost track of mileage signs and didn't know how close I was to Santa Barbara until traffic backed up, the surefire sign SLO county is behind me. As capable as it is at freeway speed, the Ninja 250 is even better splitting lanes. Other riders split ahead, and as I inevitably caught 'em up--I cut my teeth commuting San Francisco--even half-helmeted Harley types politely pulled aside to wave me on.

Tight space. Tighter. Clear. Good. A hole! Merging? Clear. Tight space. Good. Tighter. Hole! Merging? Clear. Two hours splitting later, I parked up the bike in a downtown Los Angeles hotel garage for the week.

<h3>June 18, 2010</h3>

The work days were spent on foot, though I did find saddle time with a CR250 gussied up with chainsaws and blood splatters (zombie blood, of course). Every day without the 250 got me closer to it again. Trade show concluded and I rode out of L.A. in the afterglow of the previous night's NBA Finals riot.

<div class="google-map"><iframe frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;source=s_d&amp;saddr=S+Olive+St&amp;daddr=34.786739,-119.444733+to:CA-166+W+to:US-101+N&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=FaMMCwIdjJHj-A%3B%3BFVoLFgIdCL_b-A%3BFSYcFgIdej3S-A&amp;mra=dpe&amp;mrcr=0&amp;mrsp=1&amp;sz=10&amp;via=1,2&amp;sll=34.670488,-119.590302&amp;sspn=0.66863,1.234589&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.670488,-119.590302&amp;spn=0.66863,1.234589&amp;output=embed" class="n2010_gmap"></iframe></div>

Home is more patient than business, so the return trip to San Francisco didn't demand as strict a schedule as the ride down. In planning other rides to Southern California, I've been directed to Highway 33 but never had the time to try it. Until now.

Desolate, pristine, wide and beautifully curvy. Highway 33 carves deliciously smooth turns through the Los Padres National Forest, a terrain that looks typically SoCal with tall brush and dry tan soil harshly lit by direct, overhead sunlight. A 600cc super sport could really stretch its legs back here, but my little Ninja gave me plenty of punch. Fast corners let me rarely dip below 60 mph except to dodge the occasional blue belly lizard scurrying across the heat-soaked pavement.

The fun didn't last forever. Highway 33 eventually turns arrow-straight, and my thoughts soon wandered in the direction of lunch. I pegged San Luis Obispo for a good lunch destination but underestimated the distance between the top of 33 and the 101 freeway. As dull as the last stretches of 33 may be, the 60 miles of Highway 166 back to the coast are worse. Stuck behind RVs through mountain passes is torturous, especially on an empty stomach.

By the time SLO came into view, I was more than eager to pull off the freeway and partake in a local institution by grubbing at Margie's Diner. Stuffed myself with hamburger and avocado, the bike with fuel, and rejoined US 101 for another two million engine revolutions back to San Francisco.]]></content:encoded>

<I>Velut luna statu variabilis</I>. I'm in love with California's coast, the unstoppable crashing tides, the infinite miles of rolling gray sky, the shifting floral hues flashing shades of earthy green and sun-dried yellow, the forever air of freshness. A permanence of change.

I wasn't in the mood. Having used the coast as my motoring playground these past years, it was all a bit too familiar for the sense of adventure I wanted. My sights were set toward the unseen corners of the Pacific Northwest, but getting there necessitated either of two parts of a dilemma: endure the heavy heat of the Central Valley or reluctantly retread California's western edge.

In truth, it wasn't a difficult decision, made easier when my good friend Brian, a resident of the Central Valley, dropped out of the tour. I wanted to make this year's venture as different from <a href="http://thesundaybe.st/motomalism/seattle-and-back-act-i/" class="n2010_tl">last year's</a> as possible and Brian was a part of that. When he wasn't a part of it, my insistence on a new trail waned. The coast it is, again. At least I wouldn't sweat in my leathers.

<h3>July 17, 2010</h3>

An unknown quantity of miles separated the morning me from my unknown destination. No reservations this year, rather a sleeping bag and a tent. Four bungees, a pair of side bags and a heavy squint turned the Ninja 250 into a convincing miniature of a touring bike, a 7:10 scale approximation of something more sensible folk employ for 2,500 mile journeys. Charlie and Ewan wouldn't dare.

San Francisco vanished behind me, swallowed by the lazy fog monster that annually makes my home its home during summer months. The creature's tendrils stretched further north than I'd hoped, but lunch in Tomales came with the company of sun and clear skies.

More miles, more cold, and more too-familiar towns. Bodega Bay? I'm not impressed anymore.  Jenner and Stewart's Point? Wake me up in Bragg, if I can make it. I didn't. Well south of Fort Bragg, mental fatigue tugged me off course and into a miserable cafe in a town with the miserable name of Gualala.

I'd been wrong all day, a truth elucidated by a simple cup of coffee. Only I was miserable.

I hit the road with a renewed enthusiasm, a warming urge to <I>ride</I> that evaporated the thoughts of an early day's retirement clouding my mind.

<div class="pull-quote">Miles compressed into a black hole behind the front tire</div>

Einstein proved his genius when he discovered that time and space are relative, but it's got nothing to do with velocity and everything to do with a stimulated mind. The hours before Gualala were long, but post a mug of inspired Sumatra, miles compressed into a black hole behind the front tire of my motorcycle at an impossible rate without diminishing my cognitive appreciation of the world around me. Manchester Beach, the Point Arena lighthouse, Mendocino and Fort Bragg were history before they were news, but I perceived the overcast, humbling lot.

As I neared the terminus of Highway 1, memories surfaced of last year's hurried race against the setting sun across the most perfect stretch of road I'd ever found. The twenty miles between the Pacific and Leggett twist and curl as if Highway 1 is writhing in its death throes, aware of its imminent demise and determined to make a stink about it. The road's as good as I remembered, perhaps better without the pressure of being behind a schedule. And per the laws discovered by the physicist with terrible hair and perverted by a yours truly, it was over in an instant.

Leggett was a road sign a year ago, but I was curious if there was more. A drive-through redwood tree yonder? Who could resist. More north on 101, Fortuna signaled the end of my coastal traipse. I wasted daylight with dinner in Eureka and sought a suitable spot for the tent before the sun had fully dipped under the sky. Splattered midge flies obscured my visor faster than I could scrub ‘em off and, as I turned east onto Highway 36, the last reminders of light faded behind a dense canopy of green.

Not that I could see any green, or any color other than the faint yellow glow of my high beam. The scramble for a bed I'd hoped to avoid by forsaking a schedule had taken me again. Stopped at a volunteer firehouse to ask permission to set up a tent and be off early, but no one was around. Deeper into the woods. Finally, a campsite but a sign outside insisted it was full. I cruised quietly through the grounds, looking for a secluded hole where maybe I'd get away with crashing for the night, but ran into a ranger who reluctantly gave me a riverside picnic area for the night. Under the headlight of the bike, I erected my modest quarters and slept to sounds of swishing streams and redneck camper romantic chit-chatter.]]></content:encoded>

Morning luminescence from a sun rising behind endless acres of redwoods breached the tent and squeezed open my eyelids at six o'clock in the A.M. I wanted to be packed up and out of camp before the ranger rolled through on patrol and scolded me for crashing the grounds. In my silent hustle, I planted a boot in a ripe mound of dog mess. I assume it was dog, but all-caps signage stapled to a bulletin board hinted at the possibility of bear origins.

<h3>July 18, 2010</h3>

Whoever founded the poo probably never dreamed of clinging to a bright blue rocket dashing east at the legal limit of speed on an empty Highway 36, but its progeny lived it, smeared over the foot shifter of my buzzing 250. Enough talk of poop? I agree.

Truth be told, I was motivated to an early start by more than sunlight and fear of authority. Guilt. I promised Mariel a call before I retired for the night, but cell phone reception doesn't stretch to the center of Humboldt county. She'd concluded either I was dead or an asshole, neither of which makes me happy, so I rushed east to the nearest edge of civilization in search of signal bars.

The western bends of Highway 36 tunnel through densely packed redwood forest, just stunning, fantasy flora drenched in eye-smothering green. Winding upward, breaking through the trees and into clouds, beyond the clouds and into sky before plummeting east to Red Bluff, the highway gradually warps reality from dewy coastal jungle to blazing, arid valley. One hundred and forty miles of some of the best twists in the state, every quality of paved surface imaginable, and rarely another human soul in sight. And no phone reception ‘til the end of it. Mariel wasn't in hysterics and she didn't hate me. Rather, she concluded I got myself somewhere incompatible with cell phones. Well that's reasonable.

An omelet breakfast inside an air-conditioned Red Bluff diner helped me recover from the long morning. Back on the road, escaping the heat was all that could bother my mind. I was heading for Lassen National Park and hoped for cooler weather at elevation, but didn't consider that I might have other worries ahead.

By 2,000 feet, I'd reconciled with the sun. At 4,000 feet, the bike wasn't pulling in top gear under 8,000 rpm. Around 5,000 feet of elevation, the carbureted Ninja 250 was blowing wet raspberry backfires on throttle closure. At the entrance of Lassen, a toll attendant warned that the road ahead contained ten miles of dirt. Uh, I require a second opinion. Inside the park's visitor center, I found a ranger who moonlights as an FZ1-riding motorcyclist but isn't particularly good with maps that aren't state-issued tourist simplifications. But he did confirm that traversing Lassen would involve off-roading and routed me away from Medicine Lake further north. Concerned for Mighty's oxygen-starved motor, I queried the elevation we could expect. The visitor center sits at roughly 6,500 feet and I already worried I'd have to push the bike. The summit thrusts upward another 2,000 feet still. Bring it on. Gulp.

I'd never been thankful for crawling traffic before, but a sedate pace through Lassen was welcome aboard a motorcycle spittling unspent fuel into the exhaust and feeling roughly 30% down on power. I shouldn't be hurrying through scenery like this, anyway. First, past sulfur-puffing white and tan rock beds surrounded by vibrant summer greens and yellows. Winding up a racetrack-like series of bends, I could make out the popping plight of other motorcycles with carbs. Bikers without a backfire soundtrack? You fuel-injected bastards...

I didn't expect snow in the middle of July, but plenty of the white stuff persisted atop Lassen in spite of perfectly clear, sunny conditions. The lakes were still covered in pockets of supernatural blue-glowing ice, a scene surely from another planet. 

The summit brought relief. The little Ninja huffed its way to 8,511 feet above the sea; it only gets easier from there. Carving down the mountain, I kept the revs high and throttle barely cracked in an attempt to maximize oxygen flow and improve the air-fuel cocktail combusting me forward. Elevation markers counted down the free fall, and at every significant step the bike responded with more beans.

The miles of dirt passed without a breath of danger. The 250 is no dual sport, but in a pinch its upright seating removes the drama from unpaved roads. I managed an average of 20 mph through the dusty stretch, found fuel at the other side, and rejoined the pavement to continue north toward Mount Shasta.

Great mountains habitually sneak up on me. I suppose that doesn't speak well of my situational awareness, but it's always a humbling surprise. As the highway flattened and dense evergreens stepped aside, the white-blanketed Mount Shasta spun into view, alone under the bare summer sky like the subject of an unshaken snow globe. But way more impressive. Even with Shasta behind me, the mountain demanded my attention by filling both of my rear view mirrors all the way to the Oregon border. Before crossing state lines, I glanced down to the Ninja 250's odometer, which had just ticked past 25,000 miles. There's no quit in this motorcycle.]]></content:encoded>

Photographs planted Crater Lake like a seed in my brain, projected with the impact of an M1 round, wedged near to my conscious where it tickled daydreams for a year and change. Though Seattle was the ultimate destination for my trip, the real inspiration behind my 2,500-mile motorcycle escape was Crater Lake. If pictures dominated my waking thoughts, how might I react to the real thing? Just one way to find out.

<h3>July 19, 2010</h3>

I woke up in a Klamath Falls hotel and spent the morning routing the day's ride whilst devouring the remnants of the previous night's Bing cherry binge. I'd been two days away from television and all the worst of our modern world, but I couldn't help tuning into terrible politics before vacating the city. Which had been already thoroughly vacated before me. Klamath Falls, for a town with such fripperies as a historic downtown, a massively modern public courthouse, two colleges, is disturbingly uninhabited.

I gassed up early and remembered Oregon's bizarre laws that require a station attendant hand me the gas nozzle, and which I always ignore while employee protest goes unheard outside my ear-plugged head. The bike and I were still floating at elevation and I wondered what effect the rich running might have on fuel efficiency. Just 75 miles for nearly two gallons of gas, by far the worst mileage I'd seen since giving up the GTO and its V8 thirst.

Routing through central Oregon to avoid dull roads is an impossibility. I tried, stretching Google Maps to its limits in search of bends but came short, nought but straight lines through flat, dreary, unemployed towns lined with weedy yards and rusty cars.

Highway 97 stabs north and separates Klamath Lake from bug-filled farmland to the east. Heavy traffic results in countless tiny collisions and insect deaths as the green flying things hop between water and food. Midway through the fray, I stopped to wipe clean my visor. It was hopelessly plastered moments later.

Closer to Crater Lake, the traffic dispersed and the trees turned massive, reaching, hulking spires, sentinels scrutinizing the intent of those that might disrupt the nature beyond. Klamath Lake is a handsome attraction, and I worried Crater Lake might be just the same. Klamath appeared, I gawked, and I was gone.

Another round of elevation changes brought the Ninja back to wheezing struggle. Up, up, but where's the lake? I can't have missed it.

And like a ton of bricks whipped into my gut. Behind a chain of traffic, I crested a hill and Crater Lake stunned me. Parking and removing my Shoei would take too long so I just stopped in sight of the lake and stared, mouth agape (really), for a quick fix and instant buzz. More awesome than photographs can convey.

I peeled myself away to park and brought out the camera gear to shoot my best lie. The camera captured the light, but not the majesty. Comments from other travelers were similarly understated. "Spectacular!" You think? "Looks like a painting." No artist could dream that feeling.

Crater Lake is otherworldly. An unmolested sheet of glassy blue at the bottom of a gaping, retired volcanic mount. I tried to imagine discovering the wonder before anyone else. If I hadn't confirmed it in Wikipedia, I wouldn't have believed what my eyes perceived. Crater Lake doesn't make sense on Earth.

Running the circular perimeter of the lake is Rim Drive, a two-lane ring of pavement that's only halfway motorable for much of the year. In planning the trip, I romanticized the thought of running a lap of the rim, but the reality of a limited gas tank and elevation-spoiled mileage concerned me. A park guide mentioned that the east side of the rim had just been cleared of snow and debris the previous week. I sort of had to do the lap. If a dry fuel tank left me deserted, so be it.

Less traveled corners of the rim revealed fresh views. Further east, Rim Drive passes behind hillsides that hide the lake but provide a canvass for rushing falls of melting snow.

Lap completed, I was ready to bid farewell the lake. And bid farewell altitude. I wanted back to a place where carburetors play well with the air, so I turned east onto Highway 138. The arrow-straightest miles I've ever had the displeasure to ride.

Once I'd reconnected with Highway 97, civilization and gas stations weren't far ahead. I'd done everything I wanted at the lake without suffering a crippling petrol fiasco. Now I'd suffer 100 more miles of 97, droning behind big rigs in file at a state-mandated 55 mph until Bend.

Thank Bend for 3G. And pizza. It was late afternoon when I rolled into the city and all day I'd only eaten the bag of cherries in Klamath Falls. I parked up the bike downtown and found a source of suitably familiar food, my first real meal since breakfast in Red Bluff the day before. Copped a corner seat by a window and dismantled my armor suit enough to sit comfortably without feeling comfortable. In truth, I felt out of place in the city. I'd just come from one of the world's most shocking natural wonders, still covered in the grimy dust of Rim Drive, smuggling a camera dripping ineffable blues, sure I'd just seen God. Air con and soda fountains, waiter and tip jar. And filthy me in the corner. Get me out of the city.

<div class="pull-quote">A few miles of good riding altered the chemicals draining between the cracks in my brain</div>

A quick survey of Google Maps helped me optimistically aim for a campground south of Estacada via, thankfully, roads with twists in 'em. Northwest on Highway 20 to 126, and as the tarmac got bendier my spirits lifted. The difference a road can make. Amid the torturous hours between Crater Lake and Bend, I was ready to call it quits for the day. But a few miles of legitimately good riding altered the chemicals draining between the cracks in my brain. If the sun weren't packing it in, I could go like this forever.

Though society was left in Bend, I was kept company by cheery mountains introduced by thoughtful road signs that uncannily point out the mounts just a fraction of a moment before they swing into view from behind tall evergreens. Mount Washington, Jefferson, and the Three Fingered Jack took turns exclaiming hellos, but I didn't catch their goodbyes. Before I knew it, Mighty and I landed in Detroit (not Michigan) for what should've been my last gas stop for the day.

The trip was a celebration of breaking routines, but some routines are helpful. For example, the gas-up routine: Set aside tank bag, get out wallet, swipe card, fuel up, shake nozzle free of caustic drips, and pack it all back up. But the old town station in Detroit runs on cash, not debit. I handed the teenage attendant a wad of ones and, in a hurry to avoid a handful of pennies in change--I despise pennies--I bolted before the lad came back from his register.

Turned north onto Breitenbush, the last road of the day, to bury some miles and find a campground before the sun set. I'd started the day with the very best of Oregon and ended with what might be the finest ribbon of asphalt in the Pacific Northwest. At first a glowing green, a veil of thinly-dressed branches filtered the low sun to jade-tinted sepia that washed the road and the untouched nature around it. No one but me, charging deeper into the forest as the sun crept lower, overhang grew denser, slicing divine corners carved by faultless tarmac. I wanted photos to prove the memory, but wanted to keep riding even more. No time to stop. Don't want to stop. Keep pushing.

After swapping national forests, the secluded highway mimes the curves of the adjacent Clackamas River, bobbing and weaving with the soothing flow of hurried water. Scouting for potential camp sites, I spotted a photo op I couldn't pass. After meticulously positioning the bike with the river as its backdrop, I reached for my camera inside my tank bag. Except the tank bag wasn't there.

Fuck me. Routines can be tiresome, but routines can also spare me the error of thoughtlessness. I'd hastily escaped Detroit to ditch a pocket of pennies and ended up ditching my tank bag and $1,500 worth in camera equipment. And because I was too pressed for time to stop for a photo, I didn't catch my bungle until 45 minutes too late. The drooping sun pressed me for a decision: Set up camp in daylight and leave the camera overnight, or tear arse back down Breitenbush, hope the bag wasn't lifted and settle my bed after sunset.

The mighty 250 loves to hustle. The unsympathetic urgency of time pushed me beyond the limits of law, pressed me to snap open the throttle and hold it pinned to 90 mph in the straights and drop the bike into corners at double the advised velocity. I retraced the 35 miles south to Detroit within half an hour, a pace nearly 50% faster than the spirited ride north. Mad, angry riding, the motorcycle wailing against a 13,000 rpm limit, my knees gripping the tank against braking Gs, the sound echoing against stout tree trunks lining the path.

The bellowing announced my approach and the young gas station attendant met me outside with the bag in hand. Definitely not Michigan.

Though daylight only barely remained, I savored my third run of Breitenbush. Halfway to Estacada, I found riverside camping and set up my tent with just a faint blue glow emanating from the river canyon. Checked in with the camp host and we shared our mutual affection for small motorcycles. I nervously inquired about the local wildlife, but was assured raccoons were all I'd encounter. Oh then he s'posed there was a recent report of a cougar. G'night.]]></content:encoded>

Riding a motorcycle through Washington state is a bit like Russian Roulette, but with worse odds. Death is unlikely, sure. But life-nullifying, sopping wet is a statistical certainty. That much <a href="http://thesundaybe.st/motomalism/seattle-and-back-act-iii/">I learned last year</a>.

<h3>July 20, 2010</h3>

Cold seized the river canyon like an enemy invasion but my sleeping bag beat back the advance and held out for sunrise. I wiped a dense dew from each of my belongings while packing camp back onto the bike and whispering prayers to Nature and the Universe for rain-free passage through Washington. A ceiling of clouds low overhead threatened to coalesce into drops. They either got bored or Nature appeased me; after a breakfast stop in Estacada, the sky dropped its mean mug.

Over coffee I planned the day's route. Google Maps shows Highways 30 and 84 sharing asphalt so I turned east at the first sign of 30. A quaint highway, but not the views I expected. Some miles down and I realized I'd been duped and dumped onto a tourist trap facade. It's rare I long for interstate, but a sign for 84 happily steered me back on course.

It may be the most beautiful interstate in America. Highway 84 follows the Columbia River Gorge laterally along the border between Oregon and Washington. On my left, the massively broad Columbia River reflected rippled hues of an ominous sky and the evergreen army amassed on the other side. To my right, a sheer cliff towered over the freeway whilst streams lept off its ledge in dutiful pursuit of the river.

Multnomah Falls is the greatest such march of water cascading into the Columbia. I parked up and crossed under freeway and rail tracks to view Multnomah from the bottom, but like peering up the skirt of Helen Mirren it felt like the wrong way to behold her highness. So I climbed. A paved path to the top counts down the mileage in one-quarter increments, but each successive quarter mile felt longer than the one before it. The pounds of leather that rest my worries on the bike suffocated on the hike, my clumsy boots added unwanted effort to every step. I was a sweating mess by the top but rewarded with a mile-and-a-half-high view of the gorge. And my brightly blue bike below, like a sad dog tied to a post awaiting his master's return.

Back on the road, eyes peeled for signs pointing me to the Bridge of the Gods. The bridge was more intriguing as a natural mass of mud than is the modern metal manufacture, but at just $.75 a crossing--seriously, call that a bridge toll?--there's an upside still. Over the Columbia and into Washington, still eyeing the sky, anticipating a soggy ambush that never materialized.

I love maps. In another life without Google, I could be a cartographer, gleefully organizing the world, condensing and connecting familiar reality into two-dimensional wads of knowledge and perspective. Maybe Google could use some help. Far as I could discern from my laptop back home, Wind River Road runs north into Highway 25 somewhere south of Mount Rainier, but I suspected otherwise when the going got dirty. I followed Wind River until the asphalt stopped, abruptly breaking in two unpaved directions. After consulting the limited resources at my disposal--a wrinkled print of online maps zoomed out too far to help and the guesses of an old California couple that got lost the same way I did--I decided to brave the gravel in hopes it'd soon bring me to Highway 25 and pavement.

The California couple, in the padded cockpit of a new generation Camry, asked if I wanted to take point on account of my motorcyclist urges to go fast. No thanks, two sport touring tires and street suspension aren't made for gravel. I hung back, rolling cautiously over the dusty, jagged rocks, through a slowly-settling yellow plume. I winced at each mile that rolled under my wobbly wheels, uncertain if it was a mile of progress or a mile of making matters worse. 

<!--raw--><div class="photo-frame">

<a href="http://thesundaybe.st/media/mightyandme_60.jpg"><img src="http://thesundaybe.st/media/mightyandme_60.jpg"></a>

</div><!--/raw-->

A stroke of luck: a local fisherman intercepted the California couple and knew where we turned wrong. "You'd've run outta gas following these dirt roads," he suggested lightly but the thought chilled me. If I hadn't stalled with a pointless study of my inadequate map, if I hadn't by chance met the California couple, I'd've been further down the dirt road and missed the fisherman. Out of gas in Washington wilderness.

<div class="pull-quote">Utterly, breathlessly, liberatingly alone</div>

I grew up in the boonies, so while the kindness of mountain folk doesn't surprise me in contrast to the cold indifference of San Francisco strangers, it is nonetheless refreshing and doubly so in a time of desperation. The fisherman went out of his way to guide us to Highway 25 where the California couple and I resumed our similar routes north. Feeling back on track and in charge of my fate, I confidently ripped forward, forgetting the Camry in my mirrors and reveling in empty, twisty highway miles.

Highway 25 skirts Mount St. Helens on the eastern, lonely side. I played with thoughts of alternate translations for road signs; "Road closed in winter" means "Zero traffic in summer and ice-damaged tarmac." I felt utterly, breathlessly, liberatingly alone. Mighty and I charged corners hot, braking hard, rear tire chattering over tree-root-rippled asphalt. Uphill, downhill, always a mind-arresting twist to the road, and across the valleys refreshing glimpses of St. Helens. Felt like it'd never end and I almost hoped it wouldn't.

But it does. 25 dumped me in Randle for gas and a three-halves sandwich-powered break. I rested on an outdoor bench and watched the terminus of 25 for the California couple, and they rolled by effortlessly while I finished my snack still huffing. I saddled up and continued north, past the Camry again and for the last time.

The highway climbed toward the top of Mount Rainier but reached nowhere near the peak, running me 'round the base before a mountain pass highway junction shrouded in clouds so heavy I could barely see the massive mount beside me. Steep cliff walls on my right and a sucking cold felt every time I brushed shoulders with a crashing fall of freshly liquid snow.

A few toothless drops of rain marked a transition. The road carved back down to terrestrial normalcy, through flat land and eventually through ordinary Washington towns north of Rainier. The enemy army in the sky retreated, I advanced to I-5 and skated into downtown Seattle a hero. Dropped off my burdens in a U-District hotel and rendezvoused with an old friend at the homey (and college-dorm-homely) Beth's Diner for eclectic conversation and more food than any man ought consume in a sitting. Not that it stopped me, mind.]]></content:encoded>

There wasn't much sense to staying in Seattle proper, but it sounded cooler than the East Side where all of my plans were rooted. I slept in and stumbled out of my hotel barely in time to grab lunch with a couple of old coworkers that transplanted to Redmond. One of the transplants boasted of a weekly weekend gathering of wealthy tech industry folks showing off super cars. I was a car guy before I found bikes so I'd love to see it, but that Wednesday the most exciting thing on the East Side of Lake Washington was my eye-grabbing motorbike and obnoxious-loud pipe.

<h3>July 21, 2010</h3>

After the miles of dirt riding through which I'd put ol' Mighty, I worried my chain might suffer. I'm not clever enough to bring chain cleaning and lubing supplies on the road, so it'd just run tortured for a thousand miles, out of sight but never out of mind. (I tend to worry myself over undone maintenance and, on occasion, imagined mechanical maladies. My penchant for procrastination doesn't help the anxiety.) Instead of ignoring the chain until I got back to San Francisco, I looked up a motorcycle service shop near my Seattle hotel. Fritz Scooter Repair came recommended by college kids bound to cheaply-fueled wheels and the stellar staff accommodated me on exactly no notice. A full chain service later and my mind should've been rested, 'cept Fritz-or-whatever pointed out a few other things that needed tending and parts I couldn't get until home. (Sometimes the maladies aren't imagined.)

I had to be back on the East Side for dinner con amigos, but evening traffic clogged my way. Californians--such as myself, for example--take lane splitting for granted. It is my right, as a motorcyclist, to stuff my two wheels into any small space where they'll fit. Unless I've crossed a border. I was willing to play nice with state law until 90-degree air and the northern sun microwaved me through my leathers. I split, in two senses of the word. (I felt the stink-eyed stares of commuters, whether real or imagined.)

<h3>July 22, 2010</h3>

There wasn't much sense in rushing back to San Francisco, with time in excess and me still cheerily away from home. Michael, fellow frequenter of the Bay Area Riders Forum, had invited me to stay at his Oregon coast campsite before I'd set off for Seattle. And that sounded groovy save for the fact that the site's in Bandon and Bandon is nearly 500 miles away from Seattle. Too close for two days riding, too far for one. Except to those that lack sense. I believe I've made clear my relationship with sense.

<div class="google-map"><iframe frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=I-5+S&amp;daddr=45.59207,-123.51748+to:45.19908,-123.89522+to:US-101+S%2FOregon+Coast+Hwy&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=43.149219,-124.388924&amp;sspn=0.067755,0.145226&amp;geocode=FQwo1wIdQYG1-A%3BFQautwId2EWj-CkvM99u_duUVDF7jpZx6eQYZQ%3BFeiusQIdTIKd-CmbBQtxOMPqVDGlJbpwRZXC3Q%3BFYB8kgIdqOKV-A&amp;mra=dme&amp;mrsp=3&amp;sz=13&amp;via=1,2&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=45.660127,-122.541504&amp;spn=8.307309,18.588867&amp;output=embed" class="n2010_gmap"></iframe></div>

I felt optimistic to have pegged Bandon as the goal for the day. An early departure nudged optimism closer to reality, but also subjected me to surprising biting cold. In the sucking chill of morning, I-5 has the appeal of dysentery on the Oregon Trail; I'd really rather not, but understand it comes with the territory.

Portland marked the end of my I-5 hell, and I found smaller, bendier roads to guide me westward. I aimed for Tillamook, remembering how beautiful it was <a href="http://thesundaybe.st/motomalism/seattle-and-back-act-v/">the year before</a>. Stunning sky and green green hills didn't let me down. Traffic patterns were less ideal. Cars ahead took miles to eventually reach the 55 mph speed limit of coastal 101, and without fail each time we hit the limit we also hit construction, which brought speed to not. And then the speed limit ticked down 10 mph at a time as the train of autos crept into towns, resetting the progress to 55. Over and over.

And still my optimism overlapped with reality around 6:30 PM. Michael and his wife Judy welcomed me to their camp site and I set up my tent in a corner of the lot before hopping back on the bike to find seaside seafood in downtown Bandon.

Over a nightlong conversation of everything motorcycles, I learned Michael is a fascinating man. We shared enthusiastic reports of our favorite rides and roads, and casual mentions of noted motorcycle press brought out personal stories from Michael. The man knows every hidden road I'd thought I "discovered," read Dan Walsh more than I, shot photos for big US motorcycle magazines and claimed Oregon's got, on the whole, better roads than California. Anything I thought I knew Michael knows better, and everything I didn't he does. At some point I gave up jealousy and just admired the man's experience.

<h3>July 23, 2010</h3>

There wasn't much sense in creeping out of the camp site in the dark of early morning but I hate awkward goodbyes and mine are always awkward. Instead, I left a note: "Sorry I'm out before you're up. It was a pleasure meeting you both." Before dogs Bailey and Boomer could muster a sleepy groof in protest and wake my gracious hosts, I pushed the bike to the edge of camp and thumbed the starter far enough that my dumb exhaust couldn't disturb a soul.

Though I'd got an early start, I wasn't confident I'd knock out the 500 miles between Bandon and San Francisco is a single go. And again it was nippy in the wee hours of dawn, though the Oregon coast was more stimulating than the previous day's slog down 5. The sun was still low to the east, the dim sky scarcely able to light the sea, the waves crashing against dull rock forms like black water colors sloshing imprecise ghostly shapes.

Didn't dare stop 'til California, crawling into Crescent City for gas and the heavenly pleasure of hot water on my chilled-stiff hands. A decision begged deciding: Abandon the cold and get home early by following the 101 to San Francisco, or senselessly cling to the coast, headlong into low-hanging clouds and unnecessary extra hours of Highway 1.

All morning, my brain stuck looping half-remembered verses of Rush's "Tom Sawyer." I've no idea what the lyrics intend to convey, but at the moment they were about riding my motorcycle swiftly down the edge of the Pacific Ocean. Decided.

Could've frozen my hands and chest, could've suffered sore muscles, could've felt weary from riding so many consecutive miles for so many consecutive days. But it was the best damn ride of my life.

The world and my little motorbike harmonized like never before, the ride a perfect hurried flow that rushed southward in relentless syncopation. Bandon to San Francisco, 500 miles exactly, twelve hours in the saddle. I was happy and I was home, and I was I happy to be home.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It's been just over two years since I first set off for Seattle on my Ninja 250. In retrospect, it was a quaint, safe ride up the coast to see friends. At the time it felt like a leap of faith. I'd been told by no one in particular, just the motorcycling community consensus, that a Ninja 250 was fine for putting around the city but not long-distance travel. I almost believed them, but I'm not the type to really buy into something unless I've tested it myself. I get a kick from poking holes in accepted truths. That was half my motivation.

In recent months, I've developed a strong affinity for cell phone photographs. They're terrible quality compared to the hulking digital SLR with which I usually shoot, but there's an appeal to the immediacy and ever-readiness of these low-fi lenses. I never intended to publish the following snaps outside of a hidden Facebook photo folder, but looking back they captured some moments that the bulky Canon Rebel couldn't touch. So I'm sharing them now. Two years' trips worth of shabby shots. Hope you enjoy.

And in case you haven't read the originals, be sure to check out the five-page-long ride reports: <a href="http://thesundaybe.st/motomalism/seattle-and-back-act-i/">Seattle & back</a> and <a href="http://thesundaybe.st/motomalism/just-mighty-me-i/">Just Mighty & me</a>.

Mighty dressed in touring drag for the first time. I'd never test run the saddle bags and had no idea if they'd hold tight. Ill-advised backpack is ill-advised.

Leeching wifi at Brewed Awakenings in Bandon, Oregon. I'd had a smart phone for all of a week before the trip and already couldn't imagine a world without Internet in my trousers. Not much Sprint 3G on the coast.

Second day of riding ended in Eugene, Oregon. It's a bit of a beatnik town, odd for the decade. Wandering Goat cafe had top lattes, enough to forgive the hippy patronage.

For Jeff's 30th we rode out to Mount St. Helens which, as it turns out, stopped spewing volcanic ash long ago. Instead, just rain fell from the sky. I think this is after we got back off the mountain, fueling up for the I-5 ride back into Seattle, Washington.

I don't know what to say. It's a dinosaur, somewhere in Oregon. I'd noticed it on the way north and taking a shot of it on the ride back down was some sort of motivation to keep riding when the joy of 2,000 miles motorcycling wore thin.

8,511 feet forward isn't too far--less than a couple of miles, easily done most days. 8,511 feet straight up from the sea to the top of Mount Lassen National Park, California isn't quite as easy on the lil' Ninja.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'd love to argue that a motorcycle is a perfectly suitable replacement for four wheels. Sadly, the dream deflates the first time groceries or overnight travel is involved. I've ridden a bicycle two miles home with three extra-large pizzas balanced in one palm, but there's too much involved with a motorcycle to repeat those shenanigans. The most I've dared is riding the 250 home with a pair of bicycle tires slung over my neck and shoulder.

<div class="pull-quote">It'd be nice to transport more than a fart's mass</div>

The budding motorcycle enthusiast will, at some early point in his riding career, decide that it'd be nice to transport more than a fart's mass stuffed under the passenger seat of his bike. And that calls for luggage, which is rarely cool. Steve McQueen certainly never bothered.

The balance between biker cool and nerd practical is familiar to most riders. It's a balance made when choosing a motorcycle, when picking out protective gear, and when plastering one's bike with other people's logos (if cool is the opposite of practical, "Monster" logos are the most practical). Some riders forgo practicality altogether, but they don't read blogs so I'm not concerned with their concerns.

<!--raw--><div class="photo-frame">

</div><!--/raw-->

I wanted luggage for the Ninja 250 but didn't want to risk the sleek cool of the 2008 fairings. I needed capacity to lug a week's worth of t-shirts a couple thousand miles without conjuring thoughts of pocket protectors and duct-taped glasses. I bought First Gear's Silverstone motorcycle bags. And after thousands of miles of use, they still please me.

<h2>Tank Bag II</h2>

I bought the tank bag first, mostly on a whim because I was at the local moto shop and had money burning a hole in my leathers. After swiping my card at the register, I had a flash of panic realizing that I didn't drive my car and I'd have to transport the new, largish purchase by motorcycle.

It was a dumb thought. But in retrospect it highlighted a common anxiety for riders without luggage, a nagging hesitation to do simple things like stop by a farmer's market on the way home.

It was a dumb thought because the Silverstone tank bag fits to the Ninja 250 in all of about five seconds of effort. There are optional fiddly straps for securing the bag, but the inbuilt magnets attach perfectly to the 250's metal gas tank. I've never once used those straps (they're stashed in the closet); the magnets hold firm, and I've tested them for thousands of miles at a time.

The magnetic mounting does make it easy for a thief to walk away with the bag and its contents--for a more secure fitting, the straps could be useful, though I suspect most thieves aren't bright enough to realize the bag's on magnets anyway. The upside to easy removal of the tank bag is that it's actually completely necessary. To get access to the gas filler cap, the bag must be pried off the tank and set aside. <a href="http://thesundaybe.st/motomalism/just-mighty-me-iii/">Don't leave it behind</a>.

The Silverstone tank bag is about as big as I'd want on the 250. It's larger than some bags, smaller than others but swallows a decent pile of junk. I've used it to transport a nighttime helmet visor, visor cleaning kit, and a host of equipment for (and including) my Canon Rebel DSLR. The bag's shape makes it easy to use every inch of storage space. A zip around the base of the bag goes loose to allow for an extra inch of capacity--too little difference to change the bag's usefulness, but just enough that it'll comfortably fit whatever got over-stuffed into the zipped-up case. Imagine letting loose the top pants button after a gluttonous meal, not trying to make room for more, just relieving a bit of pressure. A couple of side pockets hold separate smaller items. Useful for organizing and maintaining quick access to commonly-used stuff like lip balm, flashlights and throwing stars.

The see-through map pocket on the top of the bag is a common feature among tank bags, and for good reason. Don't buy a tank bag without one. The clear plastic swath is fairly large on the Silverstone, though the narrowness of the pocket opening requires special vertical folding of maps. A bulleted list of navigation directions slides in perfectly. The Silverstone also includes a second map pocket sewn under the bag, into the magnetic mounting base. The bag can separate from the mounting base with a zip, leaving behind a wafer-thin map pocket. I've never used the feature. If I'm going to bother fitting the mounting base, why wouldn't I also bring the bag?

Unzipping the main bag from the mounting base is the first step in converting the Silverstone tank bag into a girly-quaint backpack. Attached shoulder straps fold out from under the bag to complete the transformation. Not a great backpack, mind, but it beats extended off-bike time with a heavy tank bag in your hands.

Carrying the Silverstone tank bag by hand is a bit awkward using its standard grab handle and while holding other clobber, like a helmet and a set of keys. The magnetic flaps fold under the bag but the magnets don't get close enough to positively attract each other--it'd be hugely helpful if the magnets held the flappy mounting base tight against the bottom of the bag, but it's sadly not the case. The flaps hold, but only barely.

</div><!--/raw-->

Like the rest of First Gear's Silverstone line, the tank bag is semi-stiff in construction. The bag holds its shape even when empty, so it never looks like a sad, soggy pile of fabric. There's no guaranteed waterproofness, but the firm shell has kept contents dry in the few rainstorms it's suffered. Sitting directly behind the Ninja's windshield certainly helps.

<h2>Saddle Bags</h2>

Still flirting with the line between form and function, I opted for saddle bags that match the Silverstone tank bag. Because matching is important. Naturally, this desire for symmetrical appearance resulted in a pair of Silverstone saddle bags draped o'er the rear of my bike.

Like the tank bag, the Silverstone saddle bags sit somewhere in the middle of moto luggage sizing. They're not uselessly small, but they're also not made to supply your 'round-the-world trip with fresh skivvies every day. There's generous packing volume from the sleek bags, though the quasi-wedged shape does make it difficult to fill every square inch. Malleable items like sweatpants and cooperative small pets pack easily, but solid kit like shoes and a camera tripod take more space than they ought. Like the tank bag, each saddle bag has an optional zip that lets the bags expand outward. Here, though, the extra space is more substantial.

Fitting the Silverstone saddle bags isn't quite as effortless as slapping down the tank bag's magnetic base. A pair of straps that connect either bag to the other lay flat across the back of the Ninja with the rear seat (or cowl) removed. Lock the seat back onto the bike and the straps are effectively held in place. I experimented with additional support by employing the liberal use of included bungees, but the effort isn't necessary. I've since run the saddle bags without bungees tying 'em down and had zero issues with the bags holding in place.

The bad news is that, like the tank bag, these things aren't waterproof. Worse, the saddle bags don't get the rain blast protection of the Ninja's screen and so suffer the brunt of heavy storms to the vulnerable, penetrable zippers. I tested the bags against torrential rain in Washington and ended up with water-logged maps, soggy beef jerky, and jerky-scented undergarments. The rain didn't reach everything inside the bags, no total loss, but I certainly wouldn't trust electronics through much more than a drizzle.

A surprising number of accessories come packaged with the saddle bags, including a set of aforementioned bungees that are great for tying down additional gear (they held my tent and sleeping bag on my last big trip). A pair of fitted, waterproof booties make waterproofness a small hassle away, provided the booties are kept handy at all times.

<h2>Recommended?</h2>

I'm a big fan of the Silverstone line's look. I like that it's not boring-flat black like 90% of motorcycle gear. The carbon-fiber-wannabe weaving looks sharp on the bike and stands out with the help of a few bits of reflective piping. General construction quality is tops. The bags have a durable, thick feel that's absent in a lot of cheaper kit. My tank bag's three years old and still looks new.

The fit on the lil' Ninja is essentially perfect, the size of the bags matching the 250's proportions well. Even when completely loaded, from the saddle it's hard to tell that the bags are on the bike. As proof, it took me 30 miles and nearly an hour of hardcore riding before I realized I'd left my tank bag at a gas station in another town. The difference in riding with and without the bag is nothing; the tank bag disappears under my line of sight and doesn't obstruct view of the bike's instruments or keep me moving around the bike through corners. But do remember the saddle bags are fitted before diving into a lane split. The bags add some extra inches of width to the ride, though as with the tank bag it's easy to forget the saddle bags are even there.<a name="roadcrafter"></a>

I can't find a label on either product to tell where it's made. Wherever it's made, First Gear isn't proud. And really, there's no excuse for not making the bags waterproof. Waterproof luggage doesn't need expensive, breathable Goretex liners--my dirty socks can sweat inside for all I care--just non-porous liner and quality zips. The main construction of the bags may very well be water-resistant, but the zippers let it down and that's a significant bummer.

All things considered, I'd still recommend the bags if rain resistance isn't a top concern. The quality construction, good looks and excellent fit on the Ninja 250 make for a satisfying, if somewhat pricey, purchase. Just be careful what gets packed next to the smoked jerky.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I prefer to dwell on the beautiful moments of motorcycling, but the pastime has its dimmer moments too. Not that I've seen much, I do my best to keep far from trouble, but there are stories--short ones, mind--that spoil the worry-free image I typically portray, and which I haven't shared before.

<h2>The Volvo</h2>

I'm proud to say I've never <I>really</I> nearly crashed as a fault of my own, but early in my riding life, close calls as a result of other people's driving happened with some frequency. (Nowadays I catch their mistakes before they make them.)

I was lazing home on Highway 1 after a day in the hills, still nervously new. Gliding downhill toward a stoplight, I gradually applied brakes and--

Screeching tires, clack, handlebars wobble and brake lights flare feet in front of me.

The man in a Volvo behind me didn't spot the red light, blasted past me in my lane and clipped my left handlebar with his mirror, jerking my grip. As if the first attempt on my life hadn't satisfied, the driver then slammed on his brakes directly in front of me, forcing an evasive swerve.

I ended up in front of the Volvo, the driver keeping 50 feet back from me through intersections as if I was a bomb about to explode (I may have).

<h2>The seizure</h2>

I'd owned the DR350S for all of about 1,000 miles when I wondered if a ticking sound on hard revs was a new problem or just the 20-year-old motor's way of working. I took a chance because, fuck, I really wanted to ride the thing on my favorite North Bay route.

The long slab ride, a necessary evil before North Bay's finest, was nearly over when it happened. Uphill chugging, throttle pinned, nervous ticking and then quiet. The motor died at 65 mph on the 101 freeway.

<div class="pull-quote">Fish-tailed in the number three lane</div>

I'd saved the bike from stalls before by slipping the clutch and bumping it back to life (if I forget the petcock, she'll die while rolling--I'm used to it). But this time was different, and instead of the motor coming to life the rear tire stopped dead. Fish-tailed in the number three lane with my riding buddy behind me, who later confessed, "I'm glad it wasn't me."

And somehow I kept it up. Coasted to the shoulder, shook out my shorts and gaped a bit at the DR, not knowing what went wrong. (I later learned the bike had run dry on oil and the piston seized. That the DR was still able to bring me home is a bit of a wonder.)

</div><!--/raw-->

<h2>The push</h2>

Summer after-work evenings spent riding the hills happened more often last year. On one such trip, I ventured south on the pink thumper, reveling in empty miles of turns rushing me to the coast, diving under the setting sun, a moment so serene I-kid-you-not it waters my eyes to indulge the memory.

The joy soured lightly as I joined Highway 1 for the casual traipse north. Any slack in the throttle elicited a rapid bubbling pop from the exhaust, and I avoided shutting the throttle completely until I hit a stoplight near Half Moon Bay. Then she died.

No amount of roadside prayer would bring her back and the nearest suitable overnight abandonment lot was miles away. I shoved the bike two miles, rang up the then-fiancee, and scheduled a tail-between-the-legs pickup in town. Pure coincidence revealed a bike shop just across the street from where I planned to leave the bike. That's how I met Wolfgang.

I decided that dating your own age is a much better idea than riding a motorcycle your own age. I should add that, without any mechanical attention whatsoever (because I haven't the talent), the bike did come to life when I tried it with the choke pulled out fully. The bike had spit off necessary hoses and it still fucking worked.

<h2>The Nick</h2>

I don't know why it's so difficult to get my buddies to go riding, but I jump on every chance. One buddy--let's anonymously call him Nick--got his license years ago but keeps putting off buying his own bike for various made up reasons. So I let him ride the DR.

We'd planned to go out one November weekend but woke to a soggy morning. No real rain, just the sort of choking fog that drenches every exposed thing in the outdoors of San Francisco. Nick rang me up to gauge my level of concern. "None." I wasn't about to give up on a ride.

Alice's came, slowly, and we enjoyed a lonely breakfast in the hills to ourselves. Cold, wet, and loving it, outdoor seating under gas-burning heaters, pine scent heavy on the condensed sharp air.

<div class="pull-quote">One mirror check later and Nick wasn't in sight</div>

Back on 84, heading toward the coast, I took it slow while Nick re-acclimated to the DR. I kept Nick in my rear view, creeping over the mist-slicked, needle-strewn asphalt. One mirror check later and Nick wasn't in sight. I stopped and waited and pondered the worst.

I looped back to catch two men helping Nick pick up the DR from the side of the road. He'd low-sided coming out of a turn at 20 mph, and slid gracefully to the shoulder just as two men in two separate trucks arrived from two separate directions, perfectly timed to help.

The DR suffered some scratches, a snapped clutch lever and busted mirror and indicator on the left side. Nick suffered a boost of adrenaline. His textile gear did its job.

After some prodding of the kickstart and flat denial that the bike was broken, the DR huffed to life, unstoppable. Nick rode 40 miles home, and didn't complain until the end that a tweaked triple clamp required contortion of the handlebars just to ride straight.

<h2>The pullovers</h2>

I've thrice been pulled over by officers of the law, and ticketed only for the lamest offense. Seventy mph in a 65, please. The other two offenses were perpetrated on my darling pink motorcycle:

1) Two twits clogged the two-lane uphill freeway climbing out of Pacifica at under the limit so I pulled a shady pass between them. The officer claimed I didn't indicate, I asked if he was sure, he told me his camera would prove it and he was so certain he let me go.

2) Blatted by a Harley-mounted motor cop near the office and he chased me into the parking garage. He insinuated I broke the speed limit for alleys, even though I hadn't been in an alley, checked my tail section with a biased eye for infractions (there are none), and then told me to slow down in the parking garage because the speed limit on private property is 5 mph. Someone should tell the boys at Laguna.

<h2>The ballgame</h2>

One of the great surprises of moving offices into The City was the congested cluttered clusterfuck that is a San Francisco Giants' home game. The ballpark is a block from the new digs, and the street it's on is also the most convenient route to the freeway.

I tackled the chaos on the 250, pulled up behind a motor cop riding a DRZ400, and followed the officer between stalled lines of cages piloted by out of town idiots.

<div class="pull-quote">The cop was buried under 350 lbs. of motorcycle and LEO equipment</div>

One of the idiots opened her car door just as the motor cop split by her. Clipped the front of his bike and sent the man down, hard, between stopped cars in the adjacent lane. I paused, shocked. The cop was buried under 350 lbs. of motorcycle and LEO equipment. I jumped from my bike and lifted the dual sport off of the officer's legs, he already jabbing in his shoulder-mounted radio, furious and probably embarrassed.

My ear plugs kept me from understanding much of what the officer said, only making out that 1) he wasn't talking to me, ergo 2) he didn't offer a thank you. The face of the woman driver was much easier to translate: "What have I done?"]]></content:encoded>

				<title>The Sunday best: Dirtbags</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't confuse it for anything but religion. Come the first day of the week, weekend waning, out comes our Sunday best. The parade around <a href="http://www.alicesrestaurant.com/">Alice's Restaurant</a> in Woodside, California comprises the ordinary, the extraordinary, and every motorbike in between. I'm there to sort the best.

Look for this article to recur every time I photograph something magnificent in the hills. These photos come from August 14, a beautiful Sunday afternoon typical of the Bay Area. Cold on the coast, boiling in the mountains. But something atypical prowled the hills. The <a href="http://www.dirtbagchallenge.com/">Dirtbag Challenge</a> was on.

<!--raw--><div class="photo-frame">

<a href="http://thesundaybe.st/media/dirtbag_07.jpg"><img src="http://thesundaybe.st/media/dirtbag_07.jpg"></a>

</div><!--/raw-->

I'd just grown bored of the samey display in front of STP and wandered into Alice's lot. As I caught a glimpse of a parked-up hooptie, a raucous clatter from around the corner of 84 shook the lot and a dozen dirtbags rolled into view, riders wantonly flicking throttles for riotous whoops of un-baffled exhaust bark. I cringed, anticipating a lawless group of troublemakers as the pack stormed the lot and parked up their motorcycles with a worrying disregard for the machines. One rider tossed his bike in the bushes, another propped up his pile on a block of wood.

<a href="http://thesundaybe.st/media/dirtbag_09.jpg"><img src="http://thesundaybe.st/media/dirtbag_09.jpg" title="Shift lever contraption busted on Stage Road. Shocking"></a>

</div><!--/raw-->

I was right about the lawlessness but wrong to worry. The Dirtbag Challenge riders flaunt law with their steeds, but that's sorta the point. The event limits participants to a grand in expenses and a month in build time, encourages general dirtbaggery and results in all sorts of Franken-bikes that don't bother faking street legality.

<div class="pull-quote">Unsurprisingly, the invention broke</div>

Some of the dirtbags were just filthy bikes coated in unsavory paint jobs, but others tried a bit harder for their title. Loose wiring and makeshift seats were common, as were mismatching Japanese brands. The most attractive bikes were both built by a father and son duo, clearly homemade custom jobs but really quite handsomely made.

Which is more than I can say for one Hondawasaki, which would've been sufficiently hideous with just its lavender tank and beer keg seat. Its builder didn't stop clubbing with the ugly stick. He grafted three-foot-long handlebars onto the forks, jacked up a secondary bicycle seat to match them and then equipped the bike with training wheels. To operate the clutch lever and rear brake from such heights, the builder devised a terrible system of hand-operated bars tall enough to reach from the comically high seat. Unsurprisingly, the invention broke. The builder blames <a href="http://thesundaybe.st/adventure/farewell-2008/">Stage Road</a> and described riding the bike thusly as "frightening." I can imagine.

The lot departed in the same organized frenzy that brought them. Terrible smell.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>In memory of summer</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm bad at goodbyes, so this is hello. Hello past summer, your long days now stretching shorter into September. I'll miss you.

Truth is, I didn't take full advantage of summer. No big trips in 2011, and a lot of car and airplane travel kept me busy on the weekends. I got married, too, which I'm sure will be remembered more than the lack of moto miles this year.

<div class="video-frame"><iframe width="900" height="506" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/0RxNOf5aCCg?autohide=1&playlist=PwQw0ODeOVE,YKu5Hq75hXs&rel=0&hd=1&color=white" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

The days I did get out and <i>ride</i>? I'll keep them with me. Partly because each day spent in the hills had its own color and flavor, and also because I filmed them with my <a href="http://www.gopro.com/">GoPro HD Hero helmet camera</a>. Enjoy the footage now or in some years' time. Makes me wish I wore a helmet for my wedding.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>What kind of motorcycle do you ride?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Shit, this question again. Not that I'm tired of answering it. I just don't know how. "What kind of motorcycle do you ride?"

It shouldn't be complicated, but the answer is always awkward. I ride a 2008 Kawasaki Ninja 250.

"Oh a Ninja, like a crotch rocket."

Well, no.

Most folk don't know bikes. Most know "Ninja" means pulling a wheelie between freeway traffic lanes at 90 mph. Most know "Harley," "sport bike" and "dirt bike," and my motorcycle doesn't neatly fit into any of those categories.

<!--raw--><div class="photo-frame">

<a href="http://thesundaybe.st/media/whatkindbike_01.jpg"><img src="http://thesundaybe.st/media/whatkindbike_01.jpg"></a>

</div><!--/raw-->

It has fairings like a sport bike but the seating position is upright, making it more of a stan... Abort the conversation! It's gone all wrong, she's not impressed!

The answer can get even clumsier if I also mention my 1992 DR350S. Blank stare. It's a good thing I'm already married.

I need to find a better answer to the question. It comes up at parties, in line for groceries, at the office, and invariably my answer ruins conversation instead of sparking it. Motorcycles should be cool talk, not weird.

My answer needs to be concise, but not necessarily exact. It needs to be true without fussing about complete.

I ride <a href="http://thesundaybe.st/media/oldmen_04.jpg">a blue one</a>. Sometimes <a href="http://thesundaybe.st/media/dualsportsman_01.jpg">a pink one</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Let the inaccuracy of my lowercase-l "libertarian" evidence underlying political apathy. If any combination of my words offends, know this: I do not care enough to offend, and I do not care if an offense is perceived, only inasmuch as it suggests a failure of my writing.

Parallels between both groups daily manifest in my interactions with either, to the point that I'm nearly convinced "motorcyclist" and "libertarian" mean the same thing.

At the core of it is a desire to move forward absent the impedance of others. It is assuming complete responsibility for one's own fate; life, death, and getting to work on time. It is rejecting the coddling protection of nanny crash standards to wring out life's juice from its core.

<div class="pull-quote">Fear dissolves beneath the faith that risk mated to talent breeds reward</div>

Like libertarians, motorcyclists are oft perceived as dangerous, nihilistic. But we don't hold contempt for order, we survive in it. Common misperception paints us selfish thrillers, in black and red. The liberty to weave paths between two-ton steel traps is lunacy to caged captives. But, hand gripped tightly 'round throttle, outside knee pressed into gas tank, head tucked inside with eyes fixed on the goal, it's not lunacy that drives us, it's control. Fear dissolves beneath the faith that we can take care of ourselves, that risk mated to talent breeds reward.

Motorcyclists suffer if we crash. Others, meekly separate from liberty, suffer daily to ignore the inevitable reality: We will die, every one of us. Tragedy, by definition, is fiction. Should a man suffer the consequences of his actions, that is not tragedy. That is reality. Motorcyclists value the choice of the individual because we are all intimately connected to consequences. We recognize the dulling effect of dividing action from painful effect. Safety is assumed granted, attention and effort lose relevance. Drivers drive shitty. Bad decisions made.

Staunchly individual, yes, yet ceremoniously communal. Motorcyclists share passing waves, acknowledging a common endeavor, a shared slight of safety in pursuit of Earth's best. And while we honor the individual's choice to risk it all, we reach out to riders in need. A bike on the shoulder attracts fellow riders eager to help, not content to wait for "someone else" to deal with a problem. We don't rely on mandates or permission to solve life's troubles, rather humanity.

We stretch our necks at the mercy of chance. We believe life lives better practiced than preached. We ride motorcycles. All libertarians should.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Better years? Yes, there've been. Mighty and I didn't make any epic journeys in 2011, but that's hardly the worst the bike endured. It's been a bad year for my motorcycle.

In March, some scumbag weaseled his way into the garage and tried to steal my bike. He failed, and I took some satisfaction knowing that the would-be thief is worthless at stealing motorcycles. The bike didn't leave the garage, but the failed failure so severely damaged the ignition barrel that I couldn't unlock the steering. That insurance claim was the first I'd ever filed. Now eight months later, I've filed a total of three.

No more than a week after coming home, the bike was on its way back to the shop. A minivan backed into my motorcycle, knocking it over onto a soiled, rainy street in the Sunset district of San Francisco. I found Mighty propped up on the curb and a quick survey revealed a smashed left fairing, broken indicators and rash to various hard bits on the left side. Gutted, furious, bewildered. I purposely park my bike such that knockovers should be impossible, but the minivan driver admitted fault despite my efforts and despite a rearview camera installed in the cage. The bike was rideable, all the way back to the shop.

I was ready to proclaim 2011 a bad year for the bike even before it suffered a second attempted theft last week, roughly eight months after the first. Same story: An incompetent sack of shit snuck into the garage and violated the ignition with a hammer and a screwdriver. I'm not a vengeful man, but I wouldn't be bothered if the assault was reversed.

There's only so much a doting owner can do to prevent heartache over his motorcycle. Comprehensive insurance is a must for a bike of any value in The City. As well, I've decided that I need to ride more. Conclusively, the motorcycle is safer with me on it than not.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Ear plugs, the best cheap bike mod</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I am at once amazed and unsurprised that so few motorcyclists wear ear plugs. Amazed because, after years of using ear plugs, I can no longer stand to ride without them. Unsurprised because they've been sold the entirely wrong way by the enlightened few.

Ear plugs are pitched as preventative health care, making them about as cool as condoms to the GSX-R youth. Tinnitus, preach enlightened elders, is the wailing future of high-milers who ride unprotected. Maybe it's true. But the future is so far away and uncertain, not immediate enough to shape behavior. We ride death cycles after all!

<!--raw--><div class="photo-frame">

<a href="http://thesundaybe.st/media/earplugs_02.jpg"><img src="http://thesundaybe.st/media/earplugs_02.jpg" class="n2010_photo_full"/></a>

</div><!--/raw-->

I'll grant that preventing tinnitus is an excellent reason to wear ear plugs, but I've got a simpler one: Ear plugs make riding better, every day. They soften the din. They sharpen my focus.

I'm often asked if I don't need to hear things while riding. Sirens, car horns, my own bike's revs, all useful audio cues necessary for navigating the city alive. And I hear them all, even with NRR 33-rated Howard Leight Max plugs stuffed deep into my ears.

For anyone that's never ridden with ear plugs, here's an easy analog to understand. Drive a car on the freeway with all of the windows down. Roll the windows up. That is the difference ear plugs make.

<div class="pull-quote">Ear plugs enforce a welcome calm on the buzzing mess that is San Francisco</div>

It's not that ear plugs block all sound. Rather they cut the most grating noises to a muffled hush. Even through an aerodynamically superior full-face helmet, wind roar is deafening, frantic and fatiguing. A ten-cent pair of ear plugs improves the experience immeasurably.

Absent the berating bother of wind, freeway traffic loses its artificial frenzy. Ear plugs enforce a welcome calm on the buzzing mess that is San Francisco. I cannot measure the contribution to tinnitus a single unplugged ride to work might yield, but I can tell the difference in my mental cool. Helmet off, ear plugs out...what was all the fuss again?

Try a pair. Give ear plugs a week. In my experience there's no going back, which is more than I can say for fruity race pipes.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Aerostich Roadcrafter review</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It's for the yobs on too-tall bikes, the snobs that won't wave, the nobs with jobs too stuffy for this kid. It's for the pretend 'round-the-worlders, the growing-much-too-olders, the gray-haired and self-unaware dorks of motorcycling. The Aerostich Roadcrafter isn't for me.

I thought. I was wrong. It happens.

I want leather and the sucking flattery of shapely-armored designer cuts wrapping me in MotoGP cosplay, I thought. I gave it a shot. The intoxicating scent of leather loses its appeal when soggy wet. Ditto the joy of riding.

And even my relatively loose-fitting leather clobber took too long to fit, delayed my daily departure, and presented enough excuse for me to lazily avoid small trips on the bike--to accept the hassle of gearing up I needed a real good reason to ride.

<!--raw--><div class="photo-frame">

<a href="http://thesundaybe.st/media/roadcrafter_05.jpg"><img src="http://thesundaybe.st/media/roadcrafter_05.jpg" title="Suit looks good hanging on a rusted gate"></a>

</div><!--/raw--> 

After three years of living the snug-hugging dream of motorcycling in leather, the Aerostich Roadcrafter gradually made sense. Good in the rain and quick to dress up and down. That is precisely what I need. Now after a year with my 'Stich, the suit still suits me perfectly.

Nearly.

<!--raw--><div class="photo-frame">

<a href="http://thesundaybe.st/media/roadcrafter_10.jpg"><img src="http://thesundaybe.st/media/roadcrafter_10.jpg"></a>

</div><!--/raw--> 

Aerostich's most damning issue is the fact they're based in Duluth, Minnesota. Anyone not residing in or visiting Duluth must <a href="http://www.aerostich.com/roadcrafter-one-piece-suit.html">order online</a> and hope the enormous one-piece fits properly according to measurements made by customers, not tailors. I used a tape measure wrapped 'round my vital metrics--chest, waist and inseam--and stabbed the dark with an online order. The Roadcrafter suit fit like a glove. But Cordura doesn't stretch and a glove-like Roadcrafter is not ideal. Specifically, my man parts suffered when I leant forward in the suit, my forward-bent shoulders tugged the one-piece upward and into the boys of under. I gave the suit a week before ringing up Aerostich HQ for advice. Send back the gently-worn too-small suit and they'd start building another, one size bigger.

<div class="pull-quote">Overstating the convenience of the Roadcrafter is impossible</div>

Two weeks later, "my 'Stich" arrived. The improved fit didn't solve my comfort completely because it couldn't possibly have--I'd never before worn a one-piece and there's a degree of comfort that can't be sewed but must be learned. Bluntly, I felt awkward in the suit. It took a month of loosening up and settling in before I felt my old self on the bike. Love didn't dawn in an instant, but I knew what was good for me. The Roadcrafter would be good. It really is.

<h2>Every-day riding</h2>

Overstating the convenience of the Aerostich Roadcrafter is impossible. In twenty seconds, I'm suited, neck-to-ankle, in skin-saving abrasion resistance. In about half that time I'm disrobed. (Times verified by stopwatch and wife.) The Roadcrafter effortlessly fits over boots and whatever attire matches my destination, be it work, weekend brunch with friends or a Haight Street bar. The suit slips off and rolls into a neat wad that can be cable-locked to the bike if wildly-urinating homeless aren't a common public concern where stopped. In San Francisco, I tend to take the suit with me rather than leave it behind, though the convenient option for abandonment allows comfortable foot travel off of the bike when visiting friendlier, less human-wastey cities.

<div class="pull-quote">I can hardly remember what it’s like to worry about rain</div>

Still, San Francisco is the perfect climate for the Roadcrafter. Despite appearances, the suit isn't particularly warm riding. In fact, it breathes better than the leather stuff I wore before, as long as the bike is rolling. Walking on foot in 90-degree weather will conjure an unhappy sweat, but crack open the underarm vents and leave unzipped the upper chest of the suit and it's quite cheery inside when cutting through the air at speed. For cold weather, there's plenty of room for layers under the waterproof Goretex. I can hardly remember what it's like to worry about rain. Shove my jean legs into my boots, don the 'Stich and no downpour can make me miserable. I've braved SF freeway rush hour through sliding, splashing four-lane puddles of fallen sky and come out dry at the other end. The Roadcrafter is notorious for letting in wet at the crotch but I've hardly noticed.

<h2>Demerits</h2>

Not that I'm oblivious to all faults with the suit. Chief among my complaints is this: Not one of the Roadcrafter's myriad pockets is accessible while sitting and with gloved hands. The main front pockets fold at the lap while seated, rendering the contents inaccessible. A small breast pocket is good for a wallet and iPhone but seals shut with just a bit of hook-and-loop (Velcro) and a modest flap that I don't fully trust in the rain. Considering how gloriously practical the suit is, the Roadcrafter's pockets disappoint.

<!--raw--><div class="photo-frame">

<a href="http://thesundaybe.st/media/roadcrafter_08.jpg"><img src="http://thesundaybe.st/media/roadcrafter_08.jpg"></a>
<a href="http://thesundaybe.st/media/roadcrafter_02.jpg"><img src="http://thesundaybe.st/media/roadcrafter_02.jpg" title="Massive reflective strip across back doubles as zippable vent"></a>
<a href="http://thesundaybe.st/media/roadcrafter_11.jpg"><img src="http://thesundaybe.st/media/roadcrafter_11.jpg" title="Don't see these every day"></a>

</div><!--/raw--> 

And I worry that the liberal use of hook-and-loop will cause the suit to wear prematurely. The stuff seals various pockets as well as a long flap that covers the World's Longest Zip running from the neck of the suit down to the left ankle. I've employed the Roadcrafter nearly every day for a year and the fuzzy loops still hook strongly, though the aforementioned breast pocket flap is worn such that the hook-and-loop bond has weakened. Snaps instead of Velcro might improve the durability of the suit against daily use, though adding dear seconds to the dress-up-and-down time. Either way, I'll find room to complain.

<h2>Get one</h2>

But not much, because that about ends my negative marks of the Roadcrafter suit. The thing is fantastic and, even at nearly $900, a bargain. My favorite feature? The "Made in U.S.A." tag on the back. The suit is pure American, from the saggy butt to the under-engineered and over-built construction that's a hallmark of American durability and quality. My 'Stich has lived through 10,000 road miles so far and with a good washing could look nearly new (save for a small bit on the right leg scalded by the exposed section of my DR's exhaust). Aerostich has a reputation for long-lasting suits with lifespans expressed in decades rather than years. One year in, my Roadcrafter certainly looks ready for another ten. If I crash sometime between now and then, the folks in Duluth offer repairs and the kind of support exclusive to small, local-ish business. Need the arms shortened an inch, or a Canadian flag sewn into the breast? Aerostich will do it for a nominal fee. (The nominal fees add up significantly if multiple alterations are required. Prep the pocketbook. Get the right fit.)

As a matter of opinion, I find the Roadcrafter rather handsome. In silver-on-gray, it's nearly militaristic, air force-like austere. Three cute girls once asked me if I'd come from the moon, which might be poking fun but they also asked to come with me. Sure, there exist cooler ways to dress. But more practical gear for the daily-rider lifestyle? I find it hard to imagine anything tops the Aerostich Roadcrafter. Then again, I've been wrong before.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>The Sunday best: Ducati SS</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Because I'm a goddamn idiot, I've for a while now thought the Ducati SS of the '90s is a boring bike. It's a bit fat and flat against more modern Ducati sport bikes and I couldn't imagine why anyone would want one in the 21st century. That changed today (my opinion of the Ducati SS, not my idiocy).

It's January and the northern hemisphere but the layman wouldn't know if not for calendars and discarded Christmas trees lining The City's curbs. Surely this faultless weather and the optimism of a new year would lure beautiful motorcycles out of garages and into the parking lot of Alice's in Woodside, I thought. Some things even an idiot can reason.

Within moments of parking, I spotted an awesome Buell White Lightning in brash orange with purple highlights on the frame and wheels, proudly branded "Buell: American Motorcycles." In summary, cool as shit.

But even the Buell looked ordinary against the pot-bellied Ducati SS across the street. Yellow and black, bumblebee paint and the baddest headlight-bikini combo I've ever seen on a bike, customizations bring out the soul of the Ducati normally buried beneath layers of plastic. Missing motor covers on the right side of the motorcycle leave exposed the dry clutch and timing belt and lend a vaguely steam-punk magic to the workings of the thing.

Truth told, I had no clue what model bike it was and wanted desperately to ask its owner for the history. I never got the chance. It was after I'd got home and did some Google sleuthing before it struck me: I'm in love with a Ducati SS.]]></content:encoded>

That changed today (my opinion of the Ducati SS, not my idiocy).]]></excerpt:encoded>

				<title>The Sunday best: Old Triumph</title>
		<link>http://thesundaybe.st/old-triumph/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So cold I couldn't feel my fingertips nor the snot soaking my mustache, but he looked unfazed in jeans, tan moccasins and an open-faced helmet as he sipped a cigarette and rode in on a old Triumph that at some point during the day likely didn't run.

<div class="pull-quote">Severe clip-ons evidence resentment for practicality</div>

"It needs a lot of attention, on an almost daily basis," which I'd already guessed by the tell of a screwdriver tucked into a crevice behind the transmission. The screwdriver adjusts the bike for varying air conditions, a concern I'm glad to not share for my motorcycles.

The frame's a 1965 Triumph but according to the owner, who's been its custodian for 11 years, that's about the only part of the bike that's original. The motor is a 650 twin, though at one point the frame housed a 750. It's hard to guess what originally lived in that space.

</div><!--/raw--> 

Too nice to qualify as a rat, too ratty to be adored as a classic, the Triumph embodies motorcycling cool and carefree nonchalance. Logo stickers on the tank look older than me, and severe clip-ons evidence a deep resentment for practicality. No old analog instruments, just a pair of digital readouts clipped on the yoke for revs and speed. Mileage? The owner guesses north of 100,000, assuming we're talking about the frame. As so many parts of the bike come from other motorcycles, I bet the miles done by all parts in their former lives amount to one helluva story life's story. If steel could talk.

</div><!--/raw--> 

A half dozen jesters surrounded the Triumph, each pointing out enchanting details to the others, cracking jokes about spilling oil, and deeply admiring the machine before them. The owner emerged when most others had scattered. "I get a kick that people pore over it." He kicked it to life in moccasins and rumbled off with a cigarette dangling from his lips.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>35,000 miles later</title>
		<link>http://thesundaybe.st/35000-miles-later/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I proved 'em wrong. Not yet ready to move on.

I've now owned my little blue 250 for over four years, put 'er through more than 35,000 miles of bad riding. Not bored yet, don't think I'll ever get there.

Common myth insists a Ninja 250 is fun for learning, but quickly outgrown and dulled in a few weeks' time. I certainly didn't know better when I bought the thing but was certain I'd rebel. Ignorant, stubborn. Yes, I was a newly-born motorcyclist.

<!--raw--><div class="photo-frame">

<a href="http://thesundaybe.st/media/35000-miles-later_04.jpg"/><img src="http://thesundaybe.st/media/35000-miles-later_04.jpg"/></a>
<a href="http://thesundaybe.st/media/35000-miles-later_02.jpg"><img src="http://thesundaybe.st/media/35000-miles-later_02.jpg"/></a>

</div><!--/raw-->

If a Ninja 250 can't go fast I'd change my aim. "It's not for speed," I told myself while writing a check for a supersport doppelganger. At the time, I drove a 400-horsepower, rear-drive coupe. But not at all obsessed with going fast. Thirty-two horsepower will do. Don't worry.

Truthfully, I didn't have to change my mind. The Ninja 250 did it for me. The high-powered Pontiac was fun occasionally, but ripping open the throttle of the 250 is fun always. Half-second dabs of gas were all I'd get in the car on the same stretches of road where the motorcycle eagerly makes a couple of trips to 13,000 rpm. Perfectly cliche but I believe it: It's more fun to ride a slow bike fast than a fast one slow. So honest was my transformation that I gave up the GTO and its six-liter motor.

<div class="pull-quote">There's nothing the Ninja 250 can’t do that a bigger bike can</div>

Practical reasoning also contributed to my longstanding relationship with the Ninja 250. While I've grown to love revving the tits off the gal, I still dream of 100 horsepower and--more crucially--the quality components that come with $10,000 motorcycles. But every time I get serious about buying a new bike, I remember: The motorcycle I own is paid for; the motorcycle I own does everything I ask of it. There is nothing the Ninja 250 can't do that a bigger, more expensive bike can. The 250 brilliantly does the freeway commute to work, deftly dices San Francisco traffic, keeps up with <a href="http://thesundaybe.st/motomalism/sur-to-malibu-part-ii/">friends on liter bikes</a>, and <a href="http://thesundaybe.st/motomalism/just-mighty-me-v/">swallows miles 500 at a time</a>. What then do I gain from replacing the Ninja 250? And what do I give up?

<!--raw--><div class="photo-frame">

<a href="http://thesundaybe.st/media/35000-miles-later_03.jpg"><img src="http://thesundaybe.st/media/35000-miles-later_03.jpg"/></a>

</div><!--/raw-->

Which brings me to the heart of why, after four years and tens of thousands of miles, I'm still riding a Ninja 250. I deeply love the bike. It's brought me to the <a href="http://thesundaybe.st/motomalism/just-mighty-me-iii/">humbling Crater Lake</a>, to the <a href="http://thesundaybe.st/motomalism/seattle-and-back-act-ii/">infinite Oregon coast</a>, to the <a href="http://thesundaybe.st/motomalism/sur-to-malibu-part-i/">boy-racer hills of Malibu</a>, and to the <a href="http://thesundaybe.st/motomalism/just-mighty-me-v/">hippest streets of Seattle</a>. After stormy battles through Bay Area rush hour in the winter, I park up Mighty and behold the rain-sloshed visage with sincere gratitude. It's a pile of parts, steel wrapped in plastic coated in dust, but some days I swear the bike is my friend.

They told me I'd grow bored. But they didn't predict I'd grow fond.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It takes two people to dress one man in the Batman motorcycle suit. Not sure how many workers it takes to build the thing, but considering the myriad patches of leather that comprise its construction I guess the suit requires at least one cow.

<div class="pull-quote">More than most adults will spend to dress like Batman</div>

A lot goes into making make-believe this believable. Including approximately one thousand, seven hundred real dollars, which is more than most adults will spend to dress like Batman. However, it's not really much more than motorcyclists already spend on a full set of bike gear--a leather jacket, leather pants, leather boots and gloves can easily add up to more and will leave riders looking more Power Ranger than Dark Knight. So might <a href="http://udreplicas.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=9">UD Replica's Dark Knight Rises "costume"</a> practically displace more traditional motorcycle attire for daily riding?

Nah. I got a chance to sample the costume for a video shoot at the office, and while I spent just half an hour riding in the thing I did wear the Batman motorcycle suit for approximately five consecutive hours. It really does take the help of another consenting adult to fully dress the suit (with some practice, a dedicated Batfan might learn to cope without the extra hands). Despite the mesh construction for much of the suit, it's quite hot to be in. The suit chaffed my arms in a couple of spots--insides of my elbows and fronts of my shoulders--and the molded hard parts that contribute to the stellar, authentic Dark Knight-look restrict some movements I generally take for granted.

<!--raw--><div class="photo-frame">

<a href="http://thesundaybe.st/media/ccc_14_l.jpg"><img src="http://thesundaybe.st/media/ccc_14_l.jpg"></a>
<a href="http://thesundaybe.st/media/ccc_15_l.jpg"><img src="http://thesundaybe.st/media/ccc_15_l.jpg"></a>

</div><!--/raw--> 

Most notably, the hard chest piece gets in the way of upper arm movement and possibly contributed to the shoulder chafing. The chest facade attaches to the front of the jacket via hook and loop. (No, my pecs don't normally look like this.) The other significant problem is the, ahem, cod piece, which is flattering but presents a serious impediment to sitting down. And I like sitting down.

But where it really counts--on the bike--the Batman suit is surprisingly easy to wear. In the half hour I spent riding in the gear, back and forth through an alley, in front of a camera and on a short freeway stint with a pillion, I felt remarkably comfortable. There's some stiffness in turning my head and torso, but nothing I wouldn't expect from brand-new motorcycle leathers. As a riding suit, the Dark Knight gear is impressively functional.

More impressive than the function is the form. This thing looks incredible, no cheap Halloween abomination but an honest-to-goodness replica of Batman's suit from The Dark Knight Rises film. And it's not like I've got a Batman-quality body to make it look good, more in common physically with Michael Caine than Christian Bale, yet I still look the real deal from the neck down. Riding around San Francisco's South Beach, I felt fascinated stares from urban dwellers not easily distracted by aberrant attire.

<div class="pull-quote">The mesh gloves are a bit shit</div>

The details in the molded leather and Kevlar, the spiked forearm gauntlets, and studded utility belt do justice to the film original. The only letdowns? A cheap-looking Batman logo on the belt and mesh gloves that are, frankly, a bit shit.

Seventeen hundred American dollars will buy higher quality, more protective duds from Dainese et al., yet the Batman suit is no cos-play fake. Both as a movie replica and functional motorcycle gear, the Dark Knight Rises suit is legit. Slightly insane, sure. But then Batman's not known for his sanity.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I once met a rider who hung up his leathers for good, not for the usual reasons. He didn't stop for newly-born kids, wasn't guilted by a significant other, didn't step away after a bad crash. But, he told me, he lost his passion when he lost his San Francisco commute. Retired at a young age, he missed the daily rush of battling traffic to get to work. Everything else was poor substitute.

<div class="video-frame"><iframe width="900" height="506" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/A0dppMtxQXw?rel=0&#038;color=white&#038;hd=1&#038;autohide=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

I didn't get it. At the time my commute consisted entirely of bland freeway lanes, no battling required. I was happy to not challenge Death daily. But two years ago, an office relocation thrust me into a proper San Francisco commute. Been battling ever since. I wouldn't give it up.

<div class="pull-quote">My commute is the highlight of my waking hours</div>

"Commute" is a bad word for most, one of the worst. It's hours wasted staring at the ass of the vehicle ahead. It's sharing uncomfortable space with strangers and not being able to do a damn thing about it. Commuting is helplessness five days a week.

Not for me. Most days--this is no exaggeration--my commute is the highlight of my waking hours.

On a motorcycle, commuting is not a helpless act. I am not bound to follow the lead of the slowest common denominator. I have no awkward company but myself.

A line of dawdling cars clogging the freeway becomes a moving puzzle to overtake. Watch the gaps between them, eyes on converging lanes, and a well-timed slip between the slothful lot yields an addicting drip of joy.

As all lanes bunch up into downtown San Francisco, I batten down the hatches of my attention, focus my mental capacity on deftly filtering through a sea of autonomous steel boxes. I anticipate their moves, study the body language of shadowy figures through rear windows, constantly adjust my trajectory and pick my moments for frictionless spatial intersection.

In The City, rules dissolve in a swirling mess of urgent life. Pedestrians dart between gridlocked cars, bicyclists blindly cut through reds, drivers struggle to find a place for their oversized transport. In the middle of everything, little me acting a selfish ass on two wheels, slipping clutch and throwing revs to maintain forward momentum and find the cracks in the clockwork where speed and safety fit.

If it goes wrong, I lose big. I'm on the ground, I'm in the hospital, I'm possibly dead. If it goes right, I get to work on time. I sit behind a computer, and grin to myself. If it goes right, I can't wait for the evening battle home.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Stephanie dumped Alex</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It was, as they say, love at first sight, he a genial gent from Germany, she a silver 750 Shadow stuck in San Francisco.

I met Alex on Twitter. He'd share photos of his motorcycle love in Hamburg and I'd counter with taunting shots of my bike in the Bay Area. Not that I've contributed, but I take some pride in the beauty of the Bay and I'm disappointed so many San Franciscans are oblivious to what's outside the city's constricting dimensions. But Alex knew what thrives beyond and he wanted a tour of the North Bay. He flew to San Francisco and rented a bike he named Stephanie. I happily obliged his urge to ride.

</div><!--/raw-->

While Alex dreamed of Napa Valley, I secretly planned to shatter expectations. I plotted a morning route to fulfill his wishes, and by lunch Alex was sated. Thoroughly pleasant weather graced our passage on pleasant highways through pleasant vineyard hills. We parked our two-wheeled dates in Yountville, absorbed the sun while chewing and chatting. We'd traveled picturesque miles through wealthy California territory, but I saved the best for later. Alex had no idea.

<div class="pull-quote">The road forced Alex's eyes to smile</div>

After grub, we turned westward on St. Helena Road and I waved Alex ahead so I could capture his ride on video with my helmet cam. The mountain road climbs out of Napa Valley and bends the sort of way California roads do best. The road forced Alex's eyes to smile, and at the end he happily announced, "I've never done a road like that!"

Still further west I lead him and soon we were galloping south on Highway 1 toward Tomales, the uniform vineyard hills inland exchanged for raw coastal shades of dusty gold and green. Napa is beautiful, but clean-cut, manufactured. The coast, its fragrant cow pastures, decaying barbed-wire fences and undeveloped expanses, possesses a truer beauty to my eye. I earlier told Alex to stop at his own leisure to take photos or just memories, that I'd not leave him behind. When he disappeared from my mirrors, I doubled back to find him worshipping the landscape. He wanted every view, every inch of the coast in pictures and video to remember. Alex and Stephanie looked good together and he wanted proof.

<!--raw--><div class="photo-frame">

</div><!--/raw-->

South of Point Reyes, we entered a darkly-wooded section of Highway 1 surrounded by tall eucalyptus and carved into a series of heart-melting twists. I know the section well and reveled in it, rolled on the throttle and greedily dipped hard into the turns. I popped out the other end well ahead of Alex, expectedly, but grew worried when he didn't follow soon after. I hoped he stopped for another photo op with his lovely motorcycle companion. I regretfully report that he did not stop by his own free will.

Stephanie dumped Alex onto California Highway 1. One hundred and fifty miles into our 200-mile ride, Alex met the asphalt. Strangers passing by stopped to lift the two off the ground, and soon the local sheriff and Bolinas fire crew heroically settled the scene and patched up Alex's wounds. Alex suffered some nasty scrapes and bloody hands, but no broken bones. He walked. He joked. He was still Alex. Stephanie enjoyed less fortune, she parked in a ditch, immobilized.

The EMT brought Alex back to the local firehouse while I rode the lonely miles home to San Francisco. Stephanie remained roadside, awaiting a tow. Another day, a varied breeze off a butterfly's wing, and Alex and Stephanie might have made it work. I'll miss seeing the two together.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[My first motorcycle adventure, in retrospect, now seems like a jog down the street. I rode with a buddy down to Alice's, which seemed so far away and exotic.

I knew it was adventure at Devil's Slide. I've since seen it a zillion times, but the visual impact thrust me into another world. To this day, it represents a portal into and out of my ordinary life. It's just minutes away, but traversing the Slide is mentally transformative.

Devil's Slide is a twisty stretch of California Highway 1. It is breathtaking. The two-lane highway hugs sheer cliffs two hundred feet above the sea and passes a couple of abandoned military bunkers that look like they were cleaved from massive rocks. Devil's Slide is just two miles long, and gets its name from the adjacent mountain's tendency to fall.

It seems every other year, Devil's Slide is washed away by storms. Highway 1 south of Pacifica becomes impassable. The state grew tired of cleaning the mess and dug a tunnel through the mountain to bypass the fragile stretch of highway. Next week, the tunnel opens and <a href="http://blog.sfgate.com/cityinsider/2013/03/22/tunnel-to-replace-devils-slide-drive/">Devil's Slide is permanently closed</a>. The Slide will be left to deteriorate. In time, the mountain will shrug the highway into the sea.

I will sincerely miss this ribbon of asphalt. May it rest in peace.]]></content:encoded>

Chance is strong that my idea of planning differs wildly from what other adults might consider sufficient. I've wanted to ride my motorcycle to the Grand Canyon for years now, but waited until a week 'til takeoff to plan. When I say "plan" I refer to five minutes spent fiddling with the blue route line in Google Maps before texting a link to my hopelessly trusting riding buddy.

Any dirt roads? I didn't check. Where are we sleeping? We'll find out. Are there too long stretches without gas? Hope not. How long will it take? Precisely who knows. What do we do when we get there? Come back, I guess.

My wife had these questions and didn't like my answers. <a href="http://thesundaybe.st/sunday-cruz/">My good friend Brian</a> asked nothing, which shows I'm cashing in on some undeserved trust. He came with me.

I fitted saddle bags to Mighty for the first time in nearly three years, packed a few necessities and a lot of unecessities, and spent a Sunday morning rolling to meet Brian at his home in the Foothills.

<h3>April 7, 2013</h3>

Of course I had no plan for the day, but still managed to fit in many past-due family visits. I grew up in the Sierra Nevada Foothills and still have lots of family and a few friends left there. Got lunch with a cousin, dinner with my mom, spent an evening with my dad and little brother, and then met with Brian late at night. Brian's brother, another good friend, showed up even later, and we stayed awake 'til 1:00 am, catching up and chatting competitive League of Legends and Marvel vs. Capcom.

<h3>April 8, 2013</h3>

Brian prepared about as well I did. He wadded up some clothes and stuffed 'em into a backpack alongside a phone charger and Bluetooth headphones. A power outlet and 3G connection will satisfy him for a week, I reckon.

"We can leave at 9:00 in the morning," I suggested with all the conviction of a tumbleweed. We left at 10:00. I docked my iPhone on a handlebar mount and let it point our motorcycles toward Yosemite.

Though April seemed the best time of year for this particular trip, there was no guarantee we'd stay dry. Any later in the year, the desert stretches might bake us. Any earlier, the mountains might dump snow. But April showers...

<div class="pull-quote">Charming ’49er towns broke up the monotony of road</div>

Indeed it seemed the sky might leak. Even dressed in <a href="http://thesundaybe.st/aerostich-roadcrafter-review/">my Aerostich</a>, I still worried, though more for Brian and our bungee-corded camping gear than for my own skin.

Looking back, our first day on the road was easily the best riding. The planned travel distance was modest, Highway 49 suitably bendy, and charming '49er towns broke up the monotony of road. At lunch in Angel's Camp, we were happy to stop only because the air kept blowing colder.

"Are your feet cold?" Brian asked me. Nope. I looked at our feet. Goretex Alpinestars riding boots on mine. Mesh summer sneakers on Brian's. And ankle socks.

That wasn't the beginning of cold. We turned east and upward on Highway 120. This time of year, 120 is closed at Tioga Pass because of snow. We didn't need the pass, but before dropping into the valley the air was still snow cold.

I can only try to imagine how Brian felt, but I can describe in detail my experience. Cold is cold even bundled up on the couch at home. Remove the bundle, replace the couch with a thin foam seat and rocket it through 3D space at 60 mph. The sights are nicer than my living room -- lovely sprawling views of peaks, trees and remnant winter snow accents -- but the cold bites. In time, the cold slipped between all layers of clothing and circulated past the entirety of my body, for hours.

I fully expected to endure that cold all evening, but when the road winded down into Yosemite Valley the temperature mercifully winded up. Relatively speaking. And it wasn't the cold that made me scream "Holy shit!" in my helmet. It was Yosemite.

I have memories of Yosemite from childhood, but only vague ones. My family visited at least a couple of times, but all I remember is crawling large boulders and later badly tumbling down one of them. The expletive in my helmet came from genuine surprise. I didn't remember this.

All my old memories are eye level. Weird because once in Yosemite Valley, towering rock walls in all directions dominate the view, me like a speck at the bottom of a stone bowl surrounded by sheer marbled mountain. Waterfalls from miles in the sky free-fall vertical drops of staggering scale. My bizarre first thought: "Looks expensive," and then the humbling realization that no amount of Man's money could make Yosemite. Exquisitely nature.

Our dumb luck rewarded us a camp site minutes before the check-in office closed, and we gingerly rolled the bikes through a muddy lot soaked in the previous night's melted snowfall. We unloaded our bikes into steel bear lockers by the tent and spent the early evening walking the valley, snapping photos and tip-toeing within arm's reach of lazing grazing deer that hardly minded us, more friendly than some dogs I know. And certainly more quiet while we slept.]]></content:encoded>

Brian's phone indicated a morning temperature of 27 Fahrenheit in Yosemite Valley. We escaped the park early and by Oakhurst Brian could feel his feet again.

<h3>April 9, 2013</h3>

Warmliness is godliness. Or maybe the reverse. Copious signage along the highway celebrated a dude named Christ, and one billboard claimed, "Jesus recycles lives." That's one way to convince red country to separate their rubbish.

The squiggly blue plan I'd made for the day seemed a bit unnecessary as we ate lunch in Fresno and studied our mobile phones. I'd originally thought to aim for some interesting spot between Yosemite and Death Valley, but there's not much. And according to Google, we were just six-odd hours from Death Valley anyway. Let's just go for it? Brian agreed, because even by then he'd not realized I didn't know what I was doing.

<div class="pull-quote">It was ambitious, Yosemite to Death Valley in one day</div>

It was ambitious, Yosemite to Death Valley in one day on little bikes with the most convenient route, Tioga Pass, blocked by winter's leftovers.

It meant head-down sprinting through California's Central Valley. There's probably lots to love about living in the Central Valley -- there's probably <em>something</em> to love -- but I've never experienced any of it. Central Valley to me is miserable heat and straight highways laid with a bias for the state's shipping industry. I wanted out. So did the squirrel that threw himself in front of our bikes at 70 mph. (The squirrel is fine.)

After two hours of collecting bugs on my visor and wishing I were somewhere else, we finally turned eastward, upward, and away from the valley, riding Highway 58 toward Mojave. A hustling wind farm army at Tehachapi Pass foreshadowed an even worse time. I hardly noticed. My mind was bothered by the clock, which kept ticking faster than Brian and I progressed.

For the first time all day, I saw striking photographs in need of a shutter. Red Rock Canyon was a lovely surprise, eggshell-colored hills broken by red-layered buttes protruding just 30-50 feet above the sand. I thought to stop and snap the shots, but the clock seemed a bigger problem than not having photographs. I desperately wanted a photo in front of the kitschy faux ghost town "Robber's Roost," but time shooed us past. As did the wind.

U.S. Route 395 turned us due north, ushered us through the high desert on the back side of the Sequoia National Forest. We were peeking behind the curtains of California's adventurous mountain scenes to find a barren backstage without humans or trees or really any defining features but the wind curling up and over the mountain tops to the west and tumbling east across the desert.

Brutal wind. The saddle bags on my bike caught the blast like a sail, which may have helped were we heading east. We weren't yet. Miles of endless space separated cross roads. A sign for an upcoming turnoff gave hope of a gas stop, but more often merely signaled a perpendicular dirt path that pointed to the middle of the desert. Follow one and we might have found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barker_Ranch">Barker Ranch</a>, the rock under which Charles Manson hid from authorities after his family's filthy foul play.

It was almost six o'clock when we made our last gas stop for the day. Camping in Death Valley was out of the question -- we'd never make it before sunset -- so I resigned to calling in a hotel reservation. Still the wind roared, and I huddled near the side of the gas station to do my best to block my iPhone from the howling. The wind hadn't let up in hours and was wearing oppressive. I just wanted respite, but the eerie gas station innards spooked me back outside. Brian remained nonchalant, I couldn't tell if the rough miles bothered him. I felt guilty for leading him out there, felt guilty for not knowing when where or how we'd get to sleep. My late call to Death Valley hotels returned just one available room. I am embarrassed to admit what it cost, but the alternative seemed unthinkably bleak and probably dangerous.

Brian dropped an ear plug in his gas tank. I pulled out my bike's toolkit to try and ply the foam thing out. Two stray dogs stood 20 feet from us and barked incessantly, inching forward every time I turned away, slinking back heads-down and barking more loudly whenever I dared step toward them. And still the wind roared.

<div class="pull-quote">Miserable shit. This was a bad idea</div>

Miserable shit. This was a bad idea.

The sun had snuck low, hovering just above the western mountain tops, by the time we rolled onto Highway 190 and turned east into Death Valley. Sand flowed like ribbons in the wind, carried across the surface of the road in sheets so thick I could barely make out the asphalt. I snapped shut the vents of my helmet and tucked my chin into the collar of <a href="http://thesundaybe.st/aerostich-roadcrafter-review/">my Aerostich</a>, but sand still scratched at my eyes.

We diced a stellar series of turns up and over the Inyo Mountains. On the other side, a descent to the surface of Mars. We come from Earth, I thought aloud.

Highway 190 winds down the mountain, each sweeping turn presenting breathtaking panoramic views of the valley below. Quite the showman, that highway. The low light bathed the scene in bluish tint on top of red planet. A sci-fi scene with Brian and me at the center, racing the setting sun.

The sun dipped halfway behind the mountains far to the west, reducing my rear view to a glowing horizon on top of tall shadow and Brian's piercing high beam. Forward visibility was hardly better. The highway was unlit, my helmet visor was layered in dust, and there was little to reflect back my headlight, just a thin strip of black road and a receding sandy shoulder.

The hotel lights mercifully broke the darkness just before 9:00 pm. Two hotel staff members awaited us at check-in and hustled us to the dinner menu before the kitchen closed, before we'd even brought our bags to our room. The staff seemed genuinely relieved to get us off that highway -- Brian and I were the last guests to arrive -- and even offered a Jeep ride to a nearby general store when the hotel menu seemed too stuffy. I slept well.

<h3>April 10, 2013</h3>

Blinding sunlight watered my eyes as we stepped out of the hotel room. The previous night's wind had subsided, the sky was pristine blue. Death Valley made a friendlier impression in the morning.

Brian and I retrieved our bikes from the lower lot to pack them closer to our room. The valley was already warming. Brian was concerned about a sound from the back of his motorcycle.

<div class="pull-quote">It jangled less, but the chain worried me</div>

Took just a second to diagnose the issue: Your chain is fucked, dude. The thing jangled and flopped like chain mail, which is terrifying and decuply so in the middle of nowhere. Brian asked his local shop to replace the chain before the trip, but apparently the young mechanic protested and simply adjusted out the slack. Wrong move.

The best we could do was re-adjust the chain, apply some lubricant, and hope to nurse it to Vegas. Thirty feet from the entrance of a too-expensive hotel, with a parking valet staring unbelievingly, I walked Brian through motorcycle chain maintenance. Break the axle nut, loosen the adjusters, tighten the chain, measure the slack, bolt it back together and lube the links. It jangled less, but the chain worried me.

</div><!--/raw-->

Badwater Road goes south from where we were, through the gut of Death Valley and to Badwater Basin which is, according to one of the helpful hotel staff and Wikipedia, the lowest point in the Americas. Nearly 300 feet below sea level, I guess. Not sure what else to say about the elevation. "Lowest point in the Americas" sounds significant, but not sure why I'd care.

Death Valley doesn't need a mostest statistic to evoke awe. Just look around. The sense we were on another planet came back the moment the hotel disappeared from our mirrors. But unlike the depressing seclusion of the previous day's ride, Badwater felt vibrant and alive. The air was still, the surrounding hills close, tangible, and electric.

And in truth, Brian and I were less alone. We crossed paths with an occasional motorcyclist -- invariably on a BMW -- and high-fived a small pack of coyotes baking bones on the blacktop. Casually riding Badwater was the Death Valley experience I wished I'd had the day before.

We slept well, despite the Vegas lights strobing through thin window curtains all night. Before making a parting run of The Strip, I inspected the chain on Brian's bike. At a glance, it looked in passable shape, seemingly still taut after the previous morning's adjustment. Good enough for me.

<h3>April 11, 2013</h3>

To get to Utah, we'd first drowsily roll miles of Interstate 15 through eastern Nevada and northwestern Arizona. Think that's a helluva roster for a highway? Add California, Idaho and Montana to the list of states covered by 15. To go from Mexico to Canada, Interstate 15 is all I'd need, plus a requisite overdose of caffeine to keep awake.

The Nevada miles are forgettable, but 15 gets interesting at the east border. The highway aims straight for what appears to be a solid mountain range, and for an hour I dreaded the elevation. I wanted lazy miles, and mountain passes are rarely lazy. Or warm.

But what looked a solid wall of mountain, at the last mile in a dramatic reveal, exposed a narrow river gorge behind the veil of perspective. The highway knew all along. Clever girl.

<div class="pull-quote">I had no expectations for Zion, but it's now one of my favorite places on Earth</div>

The Virgin River Gorge spared us elevation, and ushered in the beautiful southwest. Rivers carve wonderful lines for roads. The tall mountains I didn't want to ascend were instead on either side of Brian and me, pale walls of water-worn rock zig-zagging us through Arizona and finally into Utah.

All of Utah is, evidently, fantastically photogenic. Especially Zion. I had no expectations for Zion, it was on the map and I figured why not, but it's now one of my favorite places on Earth.

Orange stone cliffs crack and buckle at the seams, smooth and sheer like ancient architecture and dotted with fuzzy green desert shrubs. The asphalt twisting through the park is similarly ginger, and romantically curvy though not the sort on which to get freaky. From Space, State Highway 9 looks like a racetrack, but it's not worth rushing.

Despite a long stop for photos and gawking from the bottom of Zion Canyon, Brian and I caught up with an RV when a park ranger stopped traffic at a tunnel entrance. Another group of motorcycle travelers pulled up behind us and, after minutes of waiting, suggested we try our luck at skipping ahead of the RV. I waddled alongside the hulking vehicle on idle engine power, expecting the yellow-vested ranger to scold me back in line. "Uh, go ahead." That wasn't very stern.

The tunnel digs into the canyon side for over a mile and without electric lighting, just occasional car-sized holes in the northern wall through which blinding natural sunlight pours and disappears in mirrors, replaced with darkness and, in my specific experience, the subtle echoed rumble of five motorcycles gently rolling toward the eastern exit of Zion.

In the absence of distracting rock formations, my eyes spied unhappy clouds in the distance. I pulled to the side of the road and told Brian, "That means rain," pointing to patches of dark cloud that looked like black metallic dust pulled down to Earth by gravity's magnetism. I learned to spot distant rain showers whilst touring the Pacific Northwest, but it doesn't do me much good. Rain or not, we still needed to get to Bryce.

The Wooly Willy rain threats haunted us, but mercifully never materialized more than a quick spritz of water drops. By then, we were more bothered by the dropping temperature.

It was after 5:00 pm when we checked into our hotel at Bryce, but had nearly 20 miles and another thousand feet of elevation before reaching Rainbow Point, what's essentially the end of Bryce Canyon National Park. It got colder on the way.

Bryce is accessible by a dead-end highway that goes south to the summit. Along the highway route, large lay-bys open views through dense trees, each view presenting different angles of the alien canyon below. Bony peach-colored points, like bunches of skeleton fingers, line the rim of the canyon and make Bryce uniquely stunning. The state highway ends at Rainbow Point, a crescendo of elevation -- 9,115 feet above sea level -- and the most impressive panorama in Utah. (In the world?)

The sun was retreating behind trees, Brian and I were freezing and surrounded by snow. We called it a day and rode back down the mountain, clopping over spindly stick shadows cast across the highway by the burnt remains of the lower forest.]]></content:encoded>

We'd been on the road over three hours before stopping. I pulled onto a sprawling off-camber highway shoulder shared by a couple of Navajo jewelry merchants.

<h3>April 12, 2013</h3>

At that point, the romantically-named U.S. 89A sweeps wide down the southern side of the mountain. The view south stretches infinite miles, the continuation of the highway visible hundreds of feet below us and stabbing southeast along the bottom of a flat canyon surrounded by wildly massive buttes. Brian scanned ahead, following the distant asphalt line to the horizon. "You sure there's gas?" No I'm not.

We passed a gas station a half hour earlier. Not because I didn't want a fill, but because of signs that rudely insisted, "Closed for winter." Hardly any snow was left on the mountain, but then likewise hardly any people were around, just the odd Harley rider and an occasional Navajo crafts seller.

The empty sound of the canyon below, a hollow hum of meandering air, was calming enough that running out of gas didn't seem so bad an end. Still, Brian's concern was warranted. We could see thirty miles down the highway from our perch, no sign of civilization other than a thin strip of lonely blacktop. I bought handmade earrings to bring home to  my wife, got back on the bike, and coasted down the mountain to chase the horizon.

We found gas in Cliff Dwellers, a town of about three single-story buildings. One building serves an impressive burger and soup. A second pipes gasoline with 50-year-old pump machines. The third is a lodge. Not sure where the employees live. I wondered, the town's name isn't literal...is it?

Soon after filling our bikes and bellies, Brian and I crossed to the southern side of the Colorado River. The entire trip was born from the dream of riding to the Grand Canyon, and the South Rim felt, only then, in reach. The Colorado River crossing gave us a first glimpse of the canyon's scary scale. Deep, narrow cracks in the earth splinter off from the river gorge just beyond the highway's edge. How deep do the cracks go? What happens when someone falls in? Would it make a good picture? No I don't want to find out.

<div class="pull-quote">No amount of struggle can stop the subconscious pressure on the off switch</div>

Relaxed daydreaming, humbling landscape. Peaceful empty miles following the Colorado.

I nearly nodded off. It was all fantastic beauty, but highways need bends. Consciously, I was far from bored, I could've sat cross-legged on the side of the road and not gone drowsy whilst surrounded by the desert views. But highways without turns are treacherously hypnotic, and no amount of conscious struggle can stop the subconscious pressure on the off switch. I almost pulled over, I should have pulled over, but worried I'd look an old man to Brian. When we finally stopped for more fuel, Brian confessed he'd also nearly given into the spell.

Since leaving San Francisco, we'd been pushing further and further east, but the transition to Arizona 64 marked the end of our migration. It was time to turn home.

The Grand Canyon crept in view, just off the north side of the highway. Each further mile came with new vistas, a surprise on the other side of every bend and crest. Narrow fingers of the canyon first, like the crevices south of Cliff Dwellers, but growing grander.

<!--raw--><div class="photo-frame">

</div><!--/raw-->

Trees obscured the view for a long while before the road kissed the canyon's South Rim. After a week on the road, 2,000 miles behind me, I met the Grand Canyon. From the rim highway, it felt like a god's-eye view of the world, the Colorado River snaking over the floor 4,000 feet below us, bright blue and fringed in green against the red and tan sedimentary layers of billions-years-old desert.

Large birds clung to outcroppings of stone between short flights over the canyon's depths, gliding on still air to another landing. The birds made me jealous, I wish I could fly. I couldn't even bring myself as close to the canyon lip as Brian dared for a photograph.

Brian and I took turns snapping each other's portrait against the extra-terrestrial backdrop before rolling into Grand Canyon Village to set up camp just a few miles away from warning signs with cougar silhouettes. After unloading the bikes, we did our best impression of a squid shoal and two-upped it on Brian's 250 without helmets, jackets or gloves to rummage food from the village market.

Christ, Brian's chain sounded awful. It crunched as we rolled slowly through the camp grounds, I could feel the friction clicking through the passenger foot pegs. When I later went back to the market to proudly strap fire wood to the bike and tow back to camp, I took my motorcycle.

We made fire, relaxed our minds, and talked the sort of personal thoughts I've only talked with Brian and his brother, when we were in high school. I see the two less often than once a year since school a decade ago. I'm happy some things don't change.

The sky stayed clear as the sun retired. We scrounged twigs to keep the fire crackling into the night, and watched the same stars last worshipped in Yosemite.]]></content:encoded>

We woke up and rode home. That's all I intended to write.

<h3>April 13, 2013</h3>

I dreaded the seventh day of our trip since even before finalizing a route. The elaborate path to Grand Canyon via Yosemite, Death Valley, Zion and Bryce, is the only interesting route to the South Rim. Returning to California necessitated the tiring exploit of some truly dull freeway.

Before packing up camp, Brian and I operated on his motorcycle's sad, crunchy chain. We adjusted and lubed the mechanical links as best we could, then rolled the bike backward and the drivetrain seized. The chain was impossibly taut at one end, and hopelessly loose at the other. We brought back some slack to the tight spots and crossed our fingers, hoping that the loose parts of the chain wouldn't jump the worn sprocket in the Middle of Nowhere, USA.

<!--raw--><div class="photo-frame">

<a href="http://thesundaybe.st/media/from-earth-phone-25.jpg"><img src="http://thesundaybe.st/media/from-earth-phone-25.jpg"/></a>

</div><!--/raw-->

The Middle of Nowhere stretches between the South Rim and Los Angeles, an empty expanse of high desert, Joshua Trees, and asphalt with all the geometric intrigue of a yard stick, some 400 miles across. Someone thoughtfully set the speed limit at 75 mph, but against a stiff headwind, my bag-saddled 250 couldn't keep pace. Big rigs jockeying for position on the two-lane highway slipstreamed past us. The ride west into California was joyless.

We rolled into Barstow at 5:30 on a Saturday evening. I parked in front of our hotel. Brian wasn't behind me, though five seconds before he had been.

<div class="pull-quote">The chain hung from the rear axle and dragged on the ground</div>

I tore off my helmet and ran around the street corner to find Brian pushing his bike off the road. The chain hung from the rear axle and dragged on the ground, having finally succumbed to our neglect. It could have been worse. The chain could have snapped hours earlier, in the middle of the Middle of Nowhere.

While I unpacked the bikes and shed my gear, Brian grabbed his oversized smartphone and searched for local motorcycle shops. Google returned three. Two of them didn't answer their phones. The third shop answered but only to say they closed for the weekend, which in shop speak means, "See ya Tuesday." Well hell.

Barstow Motorcycle Center (BMC), the lone shop to answer, was in fact more than closed. They'd shut down early on Saturday to relocate to a newer, bigger showroom. Spare parts -- like unbroken chains -- were boxed, cash registers disconnected, the old service shack padlocked closed for the last time. I pleaded with the guy on the other end of the phone to let me buy a chain, to which he replied, "You can try." There was no guarantee the parts I needed weren't buried in unmarked boxes somewhere between shops, but I was thankful for a chance. Not that I have a clue how to fit a bike chain.

Either my charm or my despair was more effective in person. I met Nathan, the general manager of BMC, and after a few minutes sussing out how they could even charge my credit card, Nathan changed objectives. Rather than just sell me a chain, he wanted to save us.

The BMC crew was on location, busy prepping the new showroom. Nathan dispatched one member to tow Brian's bike from across town. Nathan then called back the service mechanic, who'd gone home for the weekend. The lot heroically organized to patch up Brian's motorcycle and spare us two days marooned in Barstow. The response blew me away.

<h3>April 14 & 15, 2013</h3>

Over another two days, we meandered back to Earth. We tangled with traffic in Topanga Canyon, skirted the beaches of Malibu, camped in San Simeon, made fire with wet pine and fell asleep to the sloshing sound of the Pacific.

Through Big Sur on the final morning, I felt already home. California's coast, every mile, is a comfort. Isolated at times, but never lonely. Warmly blue, deeply alive, and gobsmackingly gorgeous.

At a small gas station on the edge of Highway 1, at Ragged Point, another motorcyclist reveling in the morning ride introduced himself to Brian and me. "I follow your blog," he said, him surprised to find me, me surprised to be found. Ryan rode with us over the remaining miles of Big Sur, shared company over a cup of coffee, and broke off from our sortie at Watsonville.

Brian and I finished the coastal miles to my Pacifica home.

<h2>Thanks</h2>

<strong>Thanks Mariel</strong>, my wife, for allowing me the senseless freedom (or freedom from sense) to run away for a week on a motorcycle, and for giving me a reason to come home.

<strong>Thanks Scott</strong>, a Bay Area friend, for supplying the parts and, patiently, the knowledge I needed to install USB power on my bike before leaving home. The trip would have been much more stressful without it.

<strong>Thanks Nathan, and the Barstow Motorcycle Center</strong>, for helping us when you had every reason not to.

<strong>Thanks Brian</strong>, for agreeing to ride with me. For dealing with my poor planning. For never breaking, even if your bike did. I'd wanted to do this trip for years now, but not alone. I wouldn't have ridden to the Grand Canyon without you.

<strong>Thanks Ryan, and everyone here now</strong>, for reading <em>The Sunday Best</em>. When I discovered the joy of motorcycling, I wanted to share it with everyone. If you've enjoyed these scrawlings and photos, please consider sharing with someone you know.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A behavior coach once described my personality as "high integrity," a flattering way of saying I'm unhealthily preoccupied with veracity and accuracy.

I'm not apologizing.

<h2>Loud pipes save lives</h2>

I've heard this mantra repeated by riders and non-riders alike, but never by anyone that has kids. The premise goes: If a motorcycle is loud enough that every driver on the block is annoyed, then surely the cars won't injuriously or fatally hit the motorcyclist, at least not by accident. I think it's nonsense.

Indeed, a lot of motorcycle v. automobile crashing is the fault of an unaware driver. Motorcyclists use a friendly, onomatopoeic abbreviation for this interaction with drivers, SMIDSY; "Sorry mate, I didn't see you." But there're problems with leaning on the loud pipes axiom to address SMIDSY.

The first problem is that loud pipes make a motorcycle obnoxious. Now there are degrees of loud, and I will shyly admit that my Neanderthal brain is tickled by a soaring induction roar and the occasional bark of an un-baffled V-twin. I once fitted a loud Two Bros. pipe to my 250, in a vain effort to make the bike feel more grown-up.

<!--raw--><div class="photo-frame">

<a href="http://thesundaybe.st/media/motomyths_01.jpg"><img src="http://thesundaybe.st/media/motomyths_01.jpg"></a>

</div><!--/raw-->

But it's not fair. A loud motorcycle isn't loud just for the rider and the appreciative sub-culture, it's loud for everyone. I got tired of gingerly feathering throttle through neighborhoods, accidentally triggering car alarms and generally feeling an ass. I took off the loud pipe a few years ago and I do not miss it, realizing now it was the opposite of grown-up.

That moral browbeating doesn't actually address the effectiveness of the myth in question, so I'll present an even better reason why loud pipes don't save lives: They don't.

Anecdotally, I've had fewer close calls with cars in the years since re-baffling my motorcycle than during the years with a loud pipe. And in those more recent years I've spent countless more miles riding in proximity of deadly cars. I commute San Francisco now, which should be more bike-threatening than my old daily route.

I've become a better rider, learned to better spot problems before they manifest. And that skill prevents collisions, not mystical power from exhaust noise.

A loud pipe may part the sea of traffic on occasion, but it is not reliable. I've seen loud motorcycles cut off and knocked over by cars. The "loud pipes save lives" myth is, at worst, a dangerous faith, and at best it's silly justification for selfish noise-making. (I've never seen loud-pipers dressed in high-viz yellow and toot-tooting air horns for attention.)

<h2>Scooters are safer than motorcycles</h2>

This is a myth of attitudes rather than one people commonly state aloud. Motorcycles are, appropriately, treated as dangerous potential. "Why no, I'd never," and even those that would wear leather and observe a solemn appreciation for the risks involved.

But few fear a scooter. Girls in skirts commute the city, guys in flip flops and Chrome bags roll out of bed and onto step-throughs without a passing thought for safety. It's just a scooter, right?

<div class="pull-quote">No scooter comes with skirt-proof road rash protection</div>

I can think of no reason why a scooter might be safer than a motorcycle except that its rider may be less likely to engage in tomfool behavior. Strike a scooter with a car and the result is no better than if it'd been a motorcycle hit. No scooter I know comes standard with skirt-proof road rash protection.

Motorcycles are faster than scooters, which certainly sounds dangerous except that most two-wheeled accidents happen in cities where speed limits negate the difference. 

I'm not arguing that motorcycles should be treated with the same flippant attitude as are scooters. Rather, my point is that scooters should be feared. Even the cute ones.

<h2>Ninja 250s out-handle liter bikes</h2>

Probably a result of cc-insecurity and self delusion is the myth of Ninja 250s embarrassing liter bikes in the twisties. Sure, the other guy has five times the power, but I've got a Ninja 250 and everyone knows they're best in corners.

<div class="pull-quote">The other guy has five times the power, but I've got a Ninja 250</div>

The premise is ridiculous. There is nothing particularly fantastic about the cornering ability of a Ninja 250. Objectively, Ninja 250 suspension is cheap junk against every supersport bike manufactured in the last twenty years. Our best tire options are narrow bias ply, where bigger bikes get race rubber. The aggressive lean of a supersport seat position is advantageous for man-handling a motorcycle through turns. The weight advantage of a Ninja 250 hardly makes up any difference.

The capability of a bike isn't necessarily matched by the ability of its rider, so it's possible for a Ninja 250 to outride a faster motorcycle. I've done it many times, but not by virtue of riding a better-handling bike. The notion that my cheap commuter is better cornering than a $12k race replica is pure myth.

<h2>Motorcyclists are badasses</h2>

It's flattering, really, but it's myth that motorcyclists are badasses, or even cooler than average. Truth is that motorcyclists -- the ones doing real miles, the lifestyle folks -- are more likely geeks and old guys.

No doubt, there've lived (and live) true badasses that ride motorcycles. People like early Hells Angel Sonny Barger, actor Steve McQueen, and racer Joey Dunlop fit the myth. They made the myth. Now geeks like me benefit from the lasting impression.

<div class="pull-quote">Geeks like me benefit from the lasting myth</div>

Spend any time at a modern motorcycle gathering and the myth is shattered. A quarter of American riders are over the age of fifty. The most devoted dress in waterproof onesies. We talk cubic centimeters, compression ratios, piston speeds, and electronics. Torque curves and throttle responses, radial brakes and upside-down forks. We're ordinary people, geeking out over machines with reputations much cooler than ours.

<h2>Harley riders don't wave</h2>

I've just got done generalizing a lot of things, so I'll now undermine my arguments and say that I hate generalizations. We form generalizations early and then feed them with confirmation bias until they grow true. It's an ugly human tendency that blinds us.

To wit, a lot of riders bother themselves with generalizations like, "Harley riders don't wave to me because I ride a sport bike." (It goes both ways, cruiser riders often feel snubbed by us Power Rangers.)

It's a myth that seemed true in my early years of motorcycling. Despite my being socially awkward and interpersonally distant, I waved to everyone on two wheels. When a pirate-outfitted cruiser type didn't reciprocate, I thought, "They were right, Harley guys don't wave to us!" The exceptions were un-noted.

But that is the definition of confirmation bias, which as it turns out informs some nasty logical fallacies.

The truth is that not every motorcyclist likes waving. Some guys on Harleys don't like to wave. Some sport riders don't wave. Some do. And in my more objective experience, it is impossible to conclude that there exists a pervasive bias that prevents sport bike and cruiser folks from waving at each other.

Also, who cares.

That said, it is true that BMW riders don't wave to anyone, but only true when still in range of cell phone towers.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>A matter of lust, and almost sense</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Shortly after I bought my then-new Ninja 250, I'd figured out which bike I'd own next. An exotic Triumph, a British triple, seemed suitably lusty, with character that, in 2008, drove motorcycle journalists to superlatives and wheelies.

I consumed magazines when the Street Triple flattered their covers, and the worst I could find to read about the bike is a narrow steering stop, lock to lock. In five years, I never read anything more critical than that. And I've read, hand on heart, roughly one Street Triple-related magazine article per month, every month since the first time I learned of the motorcycle.

</div><!--/raw-->

It's now 2013 and the Street Triple still earns exuberant reviews from journalists, not all of which are biased Brits. Core to the experience, say the experts, is an eager three-cylinder motor and lively gearing that shape the fireball character of the bike. The upright seating position is playful (and comfortable) compared to super-serious super sport alternatives. The bike's charming, raw appearance is savored by both enthusiasts and casual passersby, an appeal threading closed the gap between the plastic-clad and the hard-tailed bad.

The Street Triple is motorcycle. It is engine, wheels and handlebars. Playful. Unpretentious, yet elegant in a manner. It makes a wicked noise.

Three days ago, more than five years after I knew I would, I bought a Triumph Street Triple. It was a matter of time, a matter of lust, and almost a matter of sense. Newer models have abandoned the modern-classic look I love, and low-mile, unmodified used examples will become only rarer with time. Buying the bike now, while a stunning 2011 R-model taunted me from Craigslist, was only logical. And my wife told me to.

The motor is lovely, willing, and about three times more hearty than my 250's parallel twin. The bike wails an intoxicating swell of revs through trembling stainless lips. The steering lock is indeed shit. So far, that's the worst I can say of the bike, and in another five years it's likely still.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>New York bikers, bias, assumption, and panic</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In late September 2013, a group of motorcyclists in New York made national news for the wrong reasons.

An online video documenting an encounter between an SUV and said motorcycle group spread virally on Reddit, through message boards, and over broadcast news reports. The incident confirmed a common belief: Groups of motorcyclists are to be feared because they are likely outlaws.

The language used by news outlets to describe the event illustrates a clear bias that favors the SUV driver. The driver "accidentally hit" a motorcyclist, the driver was "fearing for the safety of his wife and 5-month-old child." The motorcyclists "chased" and "attacked." In nearly all descriptions, the driver of the SUV is made victim and blameless.

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=319_1380522846">"Range Rover runs over bikers in NYC"<br/>- Liveleak</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2438620/Shocking-video-Range-Rover-crashing-bikers-surround-vehicle-annual-street-ride.html">"Fearing for the safety of his wife and child"<br/>- Daily Mail</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

If the spin isn't obvious, allow me to offer another possible description of the scene. (Disclaimer: This description is biased as well, but in the other direction.)

<div class="pull-quote">The SUV driver paralyzed a man and fled the scene</div>

A bunch of everyday people got together to enjoy their motorcycles. When a guy in an SUV hit one of the motorcycles he refused to pull over, assuming the group was a dangerous biker gang. The SUV driver panicked, and belligerently rammed through the exposed motorcyclists with 6,000 lbs. of steel, smashing motorcycles and paralyzing one rider who was left comatose in the middle of a busy freeway.

The group was not a biker gang, just a bunch of people that like motorcycles and enjoy company on rides. They wear no shared colors, no unifying vests and patches. Even their bikes share few commonalities to suggest an organized band. No, these motorcyclists are not wanton outlaws, just people on a group ride like one organized in online forums every week in the Bay Area. I've been on many of these rides. Commonly, the riders don't even know each other.

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://bayarearidersforum.com/forums/showthread.php?t=441855">"Safety first always: San Francisco Monthly Night Ride"<br/>- Bay Area Riders Forum</a></li>
<li><a href="http://thesundaybe.st/200-bikes-200-miles/">"Bay Area folks organize a massive group ride"<br/>- The Sunday Best</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2445011/5-duty-NYPD-officers-bikers-involved-Edwin-Mieses-Jr-SUV-attack.html">"Mieses didn't know the people he was riding with"<br/>- Daily Mail</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

What happened after the SUV driver smashed through the group is indefensible, but, if the motorcyclists are presumed innocent in the first altercation, the chase and subsequent violence are less shocking. The SUV driver had used deadly force, paralyzed a man and fled the scene. Pretend the motorcyclists were dressed in police uniforms. The city might praise their heroism. (To be clear, I think dragging a man from his car and beating him is disgusting, even if it's done by police.)

Another recent bike-versus-auto story, this one from Pennsylvania, details a gruesome collision between an SUV and two motorcycles carrying four bikers. Five people died in the collision, including all four of the riders.

I read half a dozen stories covering the same collision, none of them had details to suggest the party at fault. But every one of the stories used language like, "Two motorcycles collided with an SUV," and, "Motorcycles collided head-on with the SUV, killing five." In these sentences, the motorcycles did the colliding and the killing.

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://thegardenisland.com/news/national/die-as-motorcycles-suv-crash-in-southern-pa/article_6f258ae6-05f0-5437-8aff-ee1b5172ab7d.html">"Two motorcycles collided with the SUV, killing five people"<br/>- The Garden Island</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

I would ignore the bias as an accidental side effect of lazy writing, except that it appeared multiple times in each article I read. The motorcycles hit the SUV, not the other way around. Despite no one having details to suggest the motorcyclists were at fault, that is the language reporters naturally adopted. And never mind that it is improbable that two motorcycles made the same mistake at the same time and hit the same SUV.

<a href="http://thesundaybe.st/media/not-a-gang-01.jpg"><img src="http://thesundaybe.st/media/not-a-gang-01.jpg" title="Not a motorcycle gang"/></a>

</div><!--/raw-->

The real-world effect of the bias is difficult to measure, but amounts to much more than hurt feelings. In upstate New York, a "boss" instructed his local police force to crack down on motorcyclists as a direct response the New York City incident. A community activist wants harsher penalties for motorcyclists that break traffic laws. An NYC mayoral candidate plays to the fear for political gain. In Australia, a new law denies bail to motorcyclists "suspected" of biker gang affiliation.

This prejudice isn't rooted in a reality where most have friends and family members who've been harmed by motorcyclists. (The reverse, however, is true; most bikers know fellow riders who've been injured or killed by cars.)

There is a widely-held opinion that motorcycles are dangerous. I suppose I agree. But that reasonable mental association imparts a modicum of bias that suggests, in the event of a dangerous outcome, the most dangerous element is to blame.

I want to be careful to not build a case of "us versus them." In any altercation or collision between a motorcycle and a car, there are individual people involved. I have no allegiance or duty to defend one of those people because of his or her mode of transport.

In the case of the New York bikers and the family man in the SUV, I am not taking sides. I do not have the details to confirm that the bikers aren't a terror and 100% to blame. I do not know if the SUV driver behaved rationally to save his family from a real threat. From my seat in California, the New York incident looks the result of bad decisions all around. But I have only the information that most others (aside from a handful of investigators and the individuals involved) have seen and read. From this information, I can make few conclusions.

And that should be okay. "I don't know" is an acceptable response to a lot of questions. It is my default, in my better moments. Humility betters bias, assumption, and panic.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>A harsh lesson in attentive riding</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yesterday morning, I crashed my motorcycle.

It sounds worse than it objectively is, but personally I'm still gutted. A broken bar end mirror and a few square inches of rash are all the bike suffered in a spill that happened at under 10 mph. I thumped my head (helmeted) and hurt my right heel, but am otherwise untouched. No one else was involved in the crash. Objectively, it hardly happened.

Over the previous night, I received a letter from Bike's managing editor sharing a proof of the magazine spread featuring my writing and set to hit British newsstands in late February. Before the day had even started, I'd hit a high, excited to see my words and photographs in (nearly) print. Moments later, I'd be launched -- o'r the high side -- to the lowest low of my motorcycle experience.

Frustratingly, I can't say for sure what happened. Possibly I was lost in thought, a habit for which I often scold myself when caught. Indeed, I sharply remember my thoughts before the crash. I pulled on my new Shoei helmet, regretted slightly the cost of it, and told myself as I mounted the Street Triple and exited my driveway toward the office, "This is why I work, to fund my motorcycle things." I work to ride, and I ride to work. I smiled and winced at the accidentally quaint circle of words.

<div class="pull-quote">The rush of waking from a falling dream, a sensation of momentum</div>

And then the rush of waking from a falling dream, a sensation of momentum pulling me sideways and down, but without a visual to confirm or a memory of what got me there. I hit the ground and stood up in an alternate reality, completely separate from the morning before the crash.

A line of cars stopped in front of me, drivers mouthing an offer of help. I lifted my sad Triumph and rolled it to the curb as one driver exited his car and asked if I needed medical attention. Nope, I was fine. Another driver, sitting in her car parked on the curb, seemed as shocked as I. "What happened? You stopped there [pointing] and then you were on the ground." My thoughts exactly.

<!--raw--><div class="photo-frame">

<a href="http://thesundaybe.st/media/crashbang_02.jpg"><img src="http://thesundaybe.st/media/crashbang_02.jpg"/></a>

</div><!--/raw-->

What the hell was that. Utter disbelief shook my confidence in reality, that I wasn't dreaming, that it was Friday, and that I was standing in the middle of the road. After traffic dispersed, I scanned the intersection for an answer, a puddle of oil, a patch of sand, or a giggling gremlin responsible for shoving me sideways onto the asphalt.

I high-sided. Making a left turn, I landed on my right. I remember the sensation of lost traction to the rear, the back of the bike swinging sideways before the fall. An examination of my rear tire revealed evidence of free spinning, a unique wear pattern around the entire perimeter of the inside edge. Why did it spin? Why did I lose traction at such low speed? Is this the dumbest motorcycle accident anyone's ever had? Had I broken a record?

I'm confident I didn't cause the spill by riding quickly. Ironically, I had been riding the Street Triple hard the previous weekend, without a hint of incident. On my favorite back road, with the suspension newly adjusted for my weight, the bike felt perfect beneath me. I was hard on the brakes, hard on the throttle, and reached the end of the road minutes ahead of my friend. The Triumph and I were melding as wholly as I'd paired with my Ninja 250. So how did I so forcefully fuck up a left turn off a stop sign, at nothing-mph?

<!--raw--><div class="photo-frame">

<a href="http://thesundaybe.st/media/crashbang_01.jpg"><img src="http://thesundaybe.st/media/crashbang_01.jpg" title="Menacing, no?"/></a>

</div><!--/raw-->

My wife tells me it doesn't matter, and she's probably right but it's not satisfying to give up on an answer. I need a reason to point at, a cause to blame, something I can say I'll never do again.

The lack of memory a moment before the fall is the best evidence of a cause. I wasn't paying attention. I found in the road some small plastic debris, and an arc of spilt liquid that may have initiated the loss of traction, but it's not enough to say for sure. And I should have seen it before the crash, not after. My habit of indulging thought on the motorcycle is one I need to temper.

Maybe I should break the habit entirely, but that would change my relationship with riding. I don't need it on my commute, or in traffic, but time alone to dwell on thoughts is high on the list of reasons why I ride a motorcycle. Perhaps that's why, emotionally, the crash feels worse than the reality of a mildly-bruised bike.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In 2013, <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2013/mar/08/business/la-fi-mo-autos-lanesplitting-controversy-safety-guidelines-from-the-chp-20130306">the California Highway Patrol published guidelines for splitting traffic lanes on a motorcycle</a>. Just weeks ago, a civil complaint <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-hy-motorcycle-lane-splitting-20140722-story.html">forced the CHP to retract it all</a> -- the guidelines are <a href="http://www.chp.ca.gov/programs/lanesplitguide.html">removed from the CHP website</a>, and all printed materials with the text are trashed.

Some <a href="http://www.americanmotorcyclist.com/NewsView/14-07-18/Lone_complaint_forces_CHP_to_remove_lane-splitting_guidelines_from_website.aspx">motorcycle groups are irate</a>. I think they should chill out.

Lane-splitting motorcycles are common in many parts of the world, but in the United States only California permits the behavior. The other 49 states ban the practice. Some American motorcyclists fear we'll lose the privilege entirely.

<div class="photo-frame"><a href="http://thesundaybe.st/media/lane-splitting-03.png"><img src="http://thesundaybe.st/media/lane-splitting-03.png"></a></div>

And some motorcyclists aren't convinced we have the privilege in the first place. "Lane splitting isn't legal, it's just not illegal," they'll often parrot. The difference between California and other states isn't that we have a law to permit lane splitting, but rather we don't have laws that forbid it. "It's a legal gray area," like all of the other things in life that aren't explicitly permitted by words written by the state congress.

The CHP guidelines for safe splitting were the closest thing to legal permission we motorcyclists had. Now they're gone, let's make a stink.

Except that's not how law works.

First, the California Highway Patrol doesn't write laws. But more importantly, there is nothing gray about the legality of things that are "not illegal." We don't need old guys in Sacramento to pass laws before we can do things unaccounted for by rules.

<blockquote><h3>Retracted CHP guidelines</h3>

<strike>Lane splitting in a safe and prudent manner is not illegal in the state of California.

Motorcyclists who are competent enough riders to lane split, should follow these general guidelines if choosing to lane split:

<ol>
	<li>Travel at a speed that is no more than 10 MPH faster than other traffic – danger increases at higher speed differentials.</li>
	<li>It is not advisable to lane split when traffic flow is at 30 mph or faster — danger increases as overall speed increases.</li>
	<li>Typically, it is safer to split between the #1 and #2 lanes than between other lanes.</li>
	<li>Consider the total environment in which you are splitting, including the width of the lanes, size of surrounding vehicles, as well as roadway, weather, and lighting conditions.</li>
	<li>Be alert and anticipate possible movements by other road users.</li>
</ol></strike></blockquote>

CHP messaging guidelines for lane splitting is like the Food and Drug Administration broadcasting, "Ham sandwiches on wheat bread with yellow mustard are permissible." Great, now there's no question whether ham sandwiches are legal.

But I prefer sourdough and Dijon with my ham. Is that sandwich permitted?

The CHP guidelines were ordered moot because the CHP has no authority to create rules. While some motorcyclists construed the guidelines as permission to split, we don't need permission. Besides, the CHP outline wasn't inclusive of much of the splitting we do daily.

<h2>The case for lane splitting</h2>

Some motorcycle groups view the takedown of the CHP guidelines as an attack on lane splitting, another nail in the coffin of freedom driven by safety nannies and car drivers scared by dare-devil motorcyclists. This paranoia may be valid.

So I'll turn my voice to non-riders unsure if lane splitting should be permitted. As <a href="http://thesundaybe.st/cracks-in-the-clockwork/">a rider who partakes in splitting daily</a>, I am interested in protecting the option.

Practical defenses of the behavior often come in two varieties, which I will summarize but won't otherwise belabor here. Some argue that many motorcycles are air-cooled and will overheat if stuck in stopped traffic. True, but not many bikes are air-cooled these days and I want to split in cold weather, too. Others suggest splitting is a safety maneuver intended to avoid rear-end collisions in stop-and-go traffic, and that's also valid but not applicable to all scenarios where motorcycles split.

I don't need to justify a lane split by one of these practicalities. There are better reasons.

<h2>We fit</h2>

Motorcyclists should be free to split lanes because we fit. As a matter of mathematics, we fit better between cars than those cars fit in highway lanes.

A typical US interstate lane spans 12 feet across, and the width of a Honda Accord -- the top-selling car in America -- measures six feet. By those numbers, a common automobile fills one half of an interstate lane.

<div class="photo-frame"><a href="http://thesundaybe.st/media/lane-splitting-02.png"><img src="http://thesundaybe.st/media/lane-splitting-02.png" title="Illustration to scale"></a></div>

This also means that, on average, there is a six-foot gap between two cars on the freeway. Any motorcycle with a width under three feet fills less of this gap, as a percentage of width, than a Honda Accord fills a full interstate lane. (My motorcycles each measure just 2.3 feet across.)

If a car fits in a freeway lane, then my motorcycle fits between cars.

<h2>We're spatially unimpaired</h2>

Critical readers will have already calculated a number I left out of the previous equation. While a motorcycle uses a smaller percentage of available space, the leftover gaps -- the distance between a lane-splitting motorcyclist and cars on either side -- are much smaller than the normal gaps between cars. In normal conditions, the gap between cars is roughly equal to the width of one car. With a motorcycle between them, the gap shrinks to a fifth of a car, or roughly half the width of a motorcycle. Yikes!

Put down the calculators and pitch forks. Though the leftover space shrinks to inches, a confident motorcyclist can deal with it. Anyone can. Most people -- not just motorcyclists -- deal with narrower margins on a daily basis.

When I'm driving a car, my spatial awareness is limited. The position and placement of every corner of the car is a best guess based on limited view through windows and past driving experience. I've not hit anything with my car, but it's because I'm cautious and overestimate the edges. Witness many drivers who swing into oncoming lanes of traffic to circumvent a bicyclist riding the shoulder. Their spatial awareness is limited by the steel box surrounding them, and they overcompensate for the doubt with anxious caution.

On a motorcycle, my spatial awareness is unimpaired. The absolute front of the bike (the front tire) I can see from my seat. The left and right extremities match the positions of my hands, and the rear of the bike is just a foot or so past my ass, the position of which I've learned well over the last 30+ years of life.

In the same way people navigate a crowded street on foot without colliding into each other, a confident motorcyclists can manage narrow gaps between cars. From the perspective of the drivers, the closeness may be uncomfortable, but from the seat of my motorcycle it ain't no thang.

<div class="photo-frame"><a href="http://thesundaybe.st/media/lane-splitting-04.png"><img src="http://thesundaybe.st/media/lane-splitting-04.png"></a></div>

<h2>We bear the risk</h2>

My final argument in the case for lane splitting: Any risk involved, we motorcyclists bear.

I know auto drivers don't want to hit motorcyclists, there's no fun in dealing with insurance or bloody bodies. But as desperately cars want to not hit motorcycles, know that motorcyclists want that collision even less.

The risk is ours. If my motorcycle hits a car, I am hurt. The driver of the auto, in all but the most extreme of possible collisions, is unharmed. I appreciate the concern, but don't beg to ban lane splitting for my sake.

For me and many motorcyclists, splitting traffic lanes is as natural as stepping around an obstacle on the sidewalk. I want to move forward and there is unused space between lanes. Telling me I can't split is rationally absurd.

Lane splitting in California is not a crime. With or without the blessing of the Highway Patrol, let's keep it that way.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[My dad bought a salvage-titled Harley-Davidson. The motorcycle is a common thread in our infrequent phone conversations over the past couple of years, as my dad updates me with progress toward a future goal of riding our bikes, together. The Harley was bought running, but missing parts. The previous owner crumpled the forks in a collision, which as far as Harley mods go isn't the most tasteless I've seen. And my dad hasn't been licensed to ride a motorcycle for decades.

The Harley was made rideable quickly, the forks replaced, brakes repaired, and dry tires filled with air. More than a year passed before my dad navigated the DMV-CHP bureaucracy to get the bike registered, plated, and cleared for road use. He's still working on the license.

<div class="pull-quote">My dad urged me to take the Harley on a joyride</div>

I recently visited my dad's house in the Sierra Nevada foothills, on a hot summer weekend. We stepped outside before noon, before the temperature reached triple digits, and my dad urged me to take the Harley on a joyride, with his reserved manner and a smile betraying an excited pride. He pulled back a tarp covering the bike and used a crusty rag to dust off a layer of dirt that settles on everything in his driveway, his idea of tidying up. "Do you have a real helmet?" I asked, hoping for something more protective than the brain bucket I know he wears. He pulled out a motocross helmet two sizes too big for my head and a pair of shaded safety glasses. "Gloves?" My dad did a lap of the garage, producing various sets of work gloves, none of them suitable for operating a motorcycle clutch. I didn't bother asking for leathers. Even if he has a jacket it'd be comically big on me and the summer temperature was climbing. Ignoring my usual inhibitions, I sat in the Harley dressed in a t-shirt, jeans, and New Balance sneakers. An oversized off-road helmet and a camera hung 'round my neck were my only preparation.

The contrast reflects a difference between my father and me that's shaped our relationship since I was a child. I have soft hands. My dad has rough hands. I work in an office in San Francisco, he works with power tools on construction sites across the state. I tiptoe around sharp things, he once lost a finger to a table saw. To be fair, he was seventeen and hasn't lost any since.

Growing up, my soft hands informed my recreation. I played video games, not sports, I built websites, not cabinets. When pressed, I uncomfortably dabbled in activities for rough hands, but rarely with conviction. My dad encouraged me to ride motorcycles, but after flipping a family friend's ATV from standstill and later bloodying my right heel trying to kickstart a dirt bike, I'd had enough. It wasn't until adulthood that I developed a taste for motorbikes.

The Harley's motor loped a steady, sturdy pulse felt through the handlebars. Into gear, and the stiff clutch lever smoothly engaged the transmission. The tires rolled gingerly over the dusty driveway and onto the dustier dirt road that connects my dad's house to civilization. I rode cautiously, partly for lack of my usual riding attire but also to learn the bike. My dad's Harley is heavy, the controls chunky, seat position lazy-boy-relaxed, a motorcycle for rough hands.

My soft hands struggled against the experience. Though the Harley is recognizably motorcycle, its controls and operation nearly identical to the bikes I commonly ride, the riding experience felt shockingly foreign. My body leaned back, my arms reached forward, legs laid into brace-like supports. Over imperfections in the road -- there are many in the foothills -- I couldn't stand up on the foot pegs, and instead relied on the bouncing rear shock and thick leather seat to absorb the asphalt's wallop. The hot summer air smashed against my chest and curled over my bare arms. My face endured the rush of wind, the open motocross helmet permitted an irregular blast that at times impaired my breathing. My dad suggested I ride to a neighboring town, but without my protective trappings I turned around early, parked the bike, and shot some photos instead.

Now I think about it, my dad is rougher than the bike, which might explain why two years after buying the Harley we've still not done a ride together. Street riding over hundreds of miles requires some concession to comfort, practicality, and law, and I don't know my dad can bother.

Where we might better connect is in the dirt. My dad also owns an old Yamaha TT500, and though he never talks about the bike it's the one I see him ride. I asked him about it and learned the TT is a motorcycle he dreamed of as a teen. In the '70s, the Yamaha brought four-stroke appeal off-road, and at the time my dad was ripping through desert washes in Arizona on whatever dirt bike he'd afforded with his paper route.

Instead of waiting for my dad to reach the street, I'm now thinking I should meet him off-road. For just a few minutes this weekend, we shared dirt, he on his 40-year-old Yamaha, I on my little brother's 80cc Honda. I'm now scheming to convince my wife: I should buy a dirt bike that lives with my dad in the foothills, waiting for my visits.

After riding my dad's motorcycles for just a few hours, I complained of a blister forming on my left middle finger. The finger was worn sore by the rough operation of either bike's clutch lever. "Your hands are soft!" my dad jabbed, and he was right. But next time I'll bring gloves.]]></content:encoded>
